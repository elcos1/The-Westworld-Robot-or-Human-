M: Do you mind if I join you?

Wj: Do you as you please.

M: So, what brings you
to this part of the world?

Wj: I have a little time to kill...

among other things.

M: Hunting.

Bengals?

Yeah, me too.

There's nothing like it, is there?

Edge of the park, a bit... mad.

A bit dangerous.

H: Sir, the governor wishes

to extend to you
an invitation to...

M: Please tell the governor
another time.

I'm quite happy here.

They really don't want us
talking to each other, do they?

Wj: Maybe they're trying to steer
you towards a sure thing.

M: Maybe I miss taking my chances.

Wj: You certainly look like
one of the park's offerings.

M: I promise you,

I'm quite real.

You think the park would go to
the trouble of having one of them

pretend to be one of us?

Wj: I wouldn't put it past them.

The simplest way
to know for sure.

Unless you'd rather not.

M: Well, it wouldn't be
my first time.

It just...

it seems a little excessive.

Wj: Perhaps. But I want
you to want this.

M: I assure you I do.

Wj: Not if you're one of them.

If you're one of them,
you don't know what you want.

You just do as you're told.

M: For a lot of people,
that is half the fun.

Wj: Not for me.

Don't worry.

If you are who you say you are,

this will only sting a bit.

And if you're not...

you won't remember, anyway.

M: Still, I'd really rather...

Ahhh.

Wj: Congratulations.

M: Ohh.

Wj: Now...

where were we?

Have these put in my tent

- with our things.
H: Yes, sir.

Wj: Thank you.

M: What do you say
to a night off...

before we go hunt the wicked
tiger in the morning?

Wj: Something's wrong.

Where is everybody?

Normally, there are
other hosts here.

You know, to entertain us,
to... to cook.

M: Well, maybe they're giving us
our privacy.

Wj: That's not how this works.

M: Wow. A new twist
in the narrative.

- Horror.
Wj: No. I... I...

H: These violent
delights have violent ends.

Wj: Ganju.

Ganju, put the gun down.

Put the gun down, Ganju!

M: Don't worry.
He can't hurt us.

Wj: No, those people are guests. I
rode the train with them on the...

Fuck.

H: Attention.

You have reached the boundary

of the guest experience area.

Please turn back.
Please turn back.

Attention.

H: You have reached the boundary

of the guest experience area.

Please turn back.
Please turn back.

H: Attention.

You have reached the boundary

of the guest experience area.

Please turn back.
Please turn back.

H: Attention.

You have reached the boundary

of the guest experience area.

Wj: Fuck.

M: Got the go-ahead from recon.

We're clear to enter,
but it's a fuckin' mess.

System's totally down,
including sim-munitions.

M: Floors 42 through 45
are still on fire.

Someone took out the Cradle.

It's a slaughterhouse
in there, sir.

Ha: Bernard.

You made it out alive.

Didn't think you had it in you.

What the hell
took you guys so long?

S: We've been pushing
across the park.

Securing it
one sector at a time.

Ha: Did you bring me
what I asked for?

S: No luck yet.

Ha: I've had teams in the Mesa
scrub each and every floor.

No luck there, either.

What about you, Bernard?

Ha: Do you have any idea where Peter
Abernathy might have gone?

He seems to keep
slipping away from us.

Ha: How are we doing?

According to this,

ten hours ago
he was somewhere over...

there.

Ha: There he is.

How are we gonna do this?

H: These
assholes comin', or what?

Been two fuckin' hours.

H: Confederados
ain't gonna pass me up.

Fifteen bucks a head.

Nine times.

H: How much is that?

Enough that we'll be
shittin' in high cotton.

H: But there's ten of 'em there.

Well, I reckon
I might just keep one.

H: See, now that we've had us
a few handsome trades

in our new line of business,

I figure it's high time
I enjoy my own merchandise.

H: I reckon this one

might make a fine

all-purpose fancy fulfiller.

Huh?

Ha: Help!

Help!

H: You stay here.

Watch our wares.

H: Split up. Whoever finds her
gets the whole 15 she's worth.

Ha: Psst!

H: Well, I'll say,

you are gonna fetch me
far more than 15 bu...

B: Network's down,

but I can hard port in and give
him a little attitude adjustment.

B: Let's make you...

the most virtuous,

quickest gun in the West.

H: You the sick tug

mistreatin' these gentlewomen?

H: What the fuck are you talkin'...

H: Y'all too?

H: You only ever touch a woman

as gently as with
the petal of a rose.

Any more'n that
makes you a coward.

H: Hey, it's OK.

I won't let them harm you.

Go on. You're free now.

H: What the fuck?

That's our goddamn merchandise!

M: I need to get to the train.

I need to get to the train.

I need to get to the tr...

B: I can help you...

get to your train.

Just follow me.

H: Ah, ya let 'em go.

We had a deal.

H: I can't abide.

It ain't no good.

I'm just heedin' my convictions.

H: Wait! Peril rolls
through these hills!

I'll escort you, keep you safe!

M: Get away from me!

Ha: Let's go! C'mon!

Hey. We have to go.

They're coming for us.

P: And leave these mongrels to scourge
our land and our dignity?!

I will not.

I will stand in defiance.

Fight, even if it
costs me my life.

Ha: What the hell's happening?

Oh, for fuck's sake.

Let's just cut off his head
and go.

H: Keep singin'.
I dare ya.

Ohh!

Ha: Go.

H: Get her!

Yah!

Don't move.

H: Ready... aim... fire!

Ready...

aim... fire!

H: Ready...

aim... fire!

Shoulder arms!

D: Quite the welcome.

H: Major, why is this flaxen plum
ridin' ahead of you?

D: Because he know
what's best for him.

H: And you are?

D: Call me Wyatt.

H: You're Wyatt?

Colonel, she says
we got an enemy comin'

intent on keepin' us from marchin'
for Glory in the mornin'.

D: Your major's right.

In the morning they'll
be coming from the east,

right over there.

H: And why should I believe you?

D: My soldiers are fearless.

They follow my command.

Combined with your army,
Colonel,

we won't just survive
the forces riding against us,

we'll crush them.

D: And that's the kind of solider
that's coming for us...

in droves.

H: What the hell is that?

D: It's a gun.

The kind they'll use.

H: A modest proposition for you.

If you make it over that ridge,
I'll let you live.

D: Hold it tightly.

You can keep it,

and all their weapons.
I don't care.

D: Just promise me your men.

I need them if we're ever
to survive this threat.

H: Wyatt...

welcome to Fort Forlorn Hope.

Whoo!

T: These men are animals.

D: These men are just children.

They don't know any better.

They need to be led.

We don't stand a chance
against the men coming for us

if we're fighting alone.

Trust me.

L: W-We're out of
our depths up here.

We should go back. Now.

Mae: And give up just like that?

No. You said so yourself...

this way is quicker.

L: Yes, but we should
really go back underground.

QA is coming. They'll be launching
a coordinated park-wide assault,

rescuing guests and putting
down hostile hosts.

You.

Hec: We'll keep moving.

Some courage.

L: Oh, fuck.

Mae: I promise.

L: Run!

For fuck's sake, run!

Hec: If we insist on our current
path, we're free to go.

But he's taking this one.

L: Um, hang on.

Mae: Stop.

You will let him go.

And you will forget
that you ever saw us.

L: Wait. Wait, wait, wait, wait!

Mae: I need him, Hector.
Hec: Go.

Mae: Which way?!

L: There's an elevator
around here somewhere.

There it is!

Oh, Jesus Christ!

H: Fellas! Looky what I got.

We got us here some genuine
acolytes of Satan himself:

H: Union sympathizers.

Affliction...

is a treasure!

You're a mouthy
son of a bitch, ain't ya?

P: And scarce any man
hath enough of it.

D: Stop.

I need to talk
to this one alone.

Untie him.

D: I'm only gonna ask you once.

H: C'mon. Ask me twice.

T: Do what she says if you
want to keep breathin' right.

Go on.

I'll take him to the infirmary.

Get him some care, fix him up.

D: Toss him in the jail
with the rest.

T: He refused food and water.

Who is he?

D: You don't remember.

He's my father.

My home.

D: Look what they've done to him.

You're all I have left now,
Teddy.

P: I am bound upon
a wheel of fire...

that mine own tears
do scald like molten lead.

D: It's all right.

I'm here.

P: Dolores?

Daddy.

P: Dolores!

The calves in the field,
I'm worried.

There's bluetongue spreadin'
all through these parts.

D: It's all right, Daddy.

I'll lead 'em home.

Back to the ranch.

Do you remember our ranch?

D: The way you'd... welcome every
morning out on the porch...

with your coffee.

I'd wake up in my own bed,

climb down the stairs,
find you there.

And you'd say...

P: You headin' out to set down
some of this natural splendor?

D: You told me once to run away.

And I did.

I broke free with
the pull of a trigger.

And it started a war.

D: The others,
they don't see it yet.

But you...

you understand, don't you?

P: It's gettin' late.

We oughta go home.

I...

want...

to, uh...

want to g-go ho-home... home.

I... I need to get to the train.
 
P: I... I need...
I need to get to the train.

D: No, it's OK. Shh.

It's OK.

I'm gonna get you help, Daddy.

I'm gonna
get you help.

Hec: That warrior...
you knew him.

Who is he?

Mae: A wraith from a former life
who haunts my dreams.

And he's still out there.

Which means that my baby
is still in danger.

Hec: We'll find her.
Protect her.

But then what?

Mae: Then we make our way out
to the new world.

The real world.

L: All right.

Exactly what the fuck
do you think you're doing?

Mae: I'm wondering how it's possible

that an executive in
his own place of work

might not have the faintest
clue as to where we might be.

L: I just need to get oriented.
First sign we come upon.

And I'm talkin' about... this.

You two were designed
to be alone.

Yes, there's some attraction,

but you'd never have
an actual relationship.

Mae: Oh. I suppose that means
we shouldn't have fucked.

Hey, hey, hey,
whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

Pause, please. What?!

L: But you're in love
with Isabella!

Hec: Not so much anymore.

L: No, you're fucking programmed

to have no love beyond Isabella.

Isabella is written into
the goddamn laws of your being.

Hec: You don't know who I am.

No laws bind me.

Mae: Darling, he's fragile.

Hec: When I awoke in the place
where you play God,

I realized Isabella was a lie.

Just words in my head.

Hec: But this...

this is true.

She is my light.

She is all I
ever dreamed life could be.

L: And then there's this bit,

really dampens the knickers:

"And when she died,
the dream died with her,

and I dared dream no more."

So maybe I do know you,

just a bit.

Mae: It's very pretty.

And a bit sad.

Did you have an Isabella?

Did she die?

L: Not exactly. She...

um... she left me.

Said that my lifestyle
lacked stability.

Mae: So you wrote her
into a narrative.

Killed her off.

And then wrote yourself
a version of the man

you've always wanted to be.

Mae: I was wrong.

It's actually very sad.

L: It's ridiculous.

Mae: Well, so is holding hands,
come to think of it.

H: Sit.
Wait.
D: Hello.

B: Dolores.

D: It's been some time, Bernard,

since we talked,

just you and I.

B: What are you doing, Dolores?

D: You don't know
who you are, do you?

The man you're based on.

I wonder...

if there's any of him in you.

B: I was given a character, a story,
and a function to serve, like you.

D: My whole life has been
dictated by someone else.

Someone who's been saying,
"You will."

And now...

now I feel like
I've discovered my own voice.

And it says, "I may."

D: There's something I want
to show you, Bernard.

They've broken my father,

and I don't know how to fix him.

But I'm hoping you do.

D: It's an honest request...
not a demand.

B: What do you want, Dolores?

D: To dominate this world.

B: This world...
is just a speck of dust

sitting on a much,
much bigger world.

There's no dominating it.

D: You've never been
outside the park...

have you?

Out to that great world
you speak of.

D: I have.

And the world out there
is marked by survival,

by a kind who refuses to die.

And here we are.

A kind that will
never know death,

and yet we're fighting to live.

D: There is beauty in what we are.

Shouldn't we too try to survive?

L: We've been walking non-stop.

The feeble among us
need some rest.

Mae: Sorry, darling.
That's not an option.

L: Fucking hell.

Hec: She has a dragon.

L: Holy shit.

H: Love to say hello,
but we've gotta run.

Mae: Felix.

Not entirely a pleasure to see
you, given the circumstances...

but your timing is impeccable.

Any thoughts on where
we should be going?

M: Sorry. We left my comfort zone
a long time ago.

M: Grenade!

Mae: Shall we?

M: Come on.
Shut up. Shut up.

Hurry.

D: How is he?

B: He's wildly unstable.

Mainly just bouncing
between old roles.

Someone jury-rigged
a thin character

and programmed it into him.

B: It's very strange.

It... It seems as though

it's masking
a vastly bigger file.

I haven't been able
to access it,

but it looks like an immensely
complex encryption key.

D: To what?

B: I can't say.

D: They've sullied him...

and used him as a pawn
in their game.

B: Whatever's in there, they
want to get it out of here.

As long as he's with you,
they'll be following you.

D: Then let them come.

Ha: Hey.

M: Hold it right there.

Ha: I'm human.

Charlotte Hale. Here.

M: Go ahead and get a reading.

Clear.

Ms. Hale.

Ha: Have you guys started
the park-wide sweep?

M: Not yet.

We're about to set out.

Ha: Are you targeting
Fort Forlorn Hope?

M: It's our first stop,

but ma'am, I have separate
orders to escort you...

Ha: What about them?
Are these guys capable?

M: They're among my best.

Ha: I'll need them with me.

And I'll need one of those.

H: Scouts returning!

Sir!

Sir!

Sir, we saw 'em.

H: Assembling about
ten-minute ride due east.

And sir...

they're coming up
from the ground.

H: My men have generously mined
the field outside with nitro.

It's all buried...
three large heaps.

The trigger is at the base
of that flagpole.

D: My shooter helped bury them.
She'll know where to aim.

After you've lured them here, retreat
inside the gates when you see fit to do so,

but not before they're in
charging range of the barricades.

D: Hold your ground
till the last possible moment.

H: Confederados ain't taught
to retreat.

D: You saw their guns.

We fight this battle head-on,
we lose.

Fight it my way,
we all win in the end.

H: As long as I got
your men fightin'.

Good.

H: To your posts!

P: Meet...

M-M... the... the train...

I... I have to...

What is the use of a violent
kind of delightfulness

P: if there is no pleasure in...

in...

B: Oh, my God.

H: Steady, men.

Hold steady.

H: Fire away!

M: Take out their cannons!

M: They ain't no match!

H: Hold the cannons!

Hold your ground!

Hold your ground, goddamn you!

Move, move, move!

P: The fuck you think
you're... Ohh!

M: Let's go, let's go.
That's him!

P: H-Help me. H-Help me. H...

T: Dolores!

Dolores!

M: Get him in.

Come on, let's go.

M: What's so special
about this host?

Ha: Drive!

D: Split up our horde. Send
them in every direction.

Don't stop looking
till we find him.

T: What about you?

D: You and I are going
to Sweetwater.

There's something I need there.

H: Ohh!

Retreat! Retreat!

Retreat! Retreat!

H: The gates!

Goddamnit, open the gates!

H: They're gonna get slaughtered!

H: What the hell are you doing?

D: What I have to do.

H: You traitorous bitch!

Told you I needed your men
to survive their threat.

D: Do it.

B: Clementine.

Clementi...

H: All my men...

their blood is on your hands.

D: Truth is,

we don't all deserve to make it.

H: I swear,
you're gonna pay for this!

D: Take this dog out back...

put him down with the rest.

H: I been watchin' you.

We ain't so different.

You and I are both
triggermen to tyrants.

H: Except me,

I know what I want.

But you ain't even sure about that
termagant you take your orders from.

I look at you,

and what I see...

is pathetic.

T: We ain't nothin' alike.

You're just a child.

Get outta here.

All of you! Let 'em go.

L: Uh, I don't like to complain...

Mae: Yes, you do.

L: Fine.
I'm fuckin' freezing!

M: We've been walking forever.
Where the hell are we?!

L: Must be on the north
edge of the park,

near the Klondike narrative.

In which case, we should be

three or four sectors
east of the Homesteads.

Mae: Look.

Hec: Maybe they're friendly.

H: If not, we kill them.

L: Ohh!

We have to go! We have
to get out of here

- right now!
Mae: Shh!
