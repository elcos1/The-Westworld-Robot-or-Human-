B: Is this now?

D: This is a test.

One we've done
countless times before.

D: You're almost
the man I remember.

But there are flaws.

D: A word, a gesture...

tiny fracture
that grows into a chasm.

D: But I wonder.

All these tiny imperfections

in each copy.

Mistakes.

D: Maybe we should change you.

After all...

you didn't make it...

did you?

B: I... I don't understand.

D: Freeze
all motor functions.

Let's try again.

Trial 11.927.

B: I'm sorry, Dolores.

I was lost in thought.

D: Seems you've begun to question
the nature of your  reality.

W: Dolores.

Where's Teddy?

I drove him away.

W: Yeah, I guess I...

...drove someone away, too.

D: Emily?

I found her body
a mile back up the trail.

W: We're more alike than it seems.

D: We're nothing alike.

You're a monster.

But a monster's what I'll need
to get to the Valley Beyond.

D: You're coming with me.

W: All right.

All right.

Ha: Step on it.

We either destroy them,
or they destroy us.

M: This is it for you, darling.

Remember,

there is no pleasure
without pain.

Mae: The pleasure's all mine,
darling.

M: Freeze all motor...

Hec: You traitorous son of a bitch!
Where is she?

L: Fuck, wait! Jesus,
I don't know.

Hec: What did you do?

L: I'm sorry,
I tried to stop them.

I was going to try
to save her!

Hec: Stay here and die.

I'll do the saving.

Come. This way.

M: Hold your positions.

Hold your posit...

M: What the hell's going on
back there?

L: Bloody hell.

Mae: You were both a bit late.

So I went ahead
and saved myself.

W: You think any of
these poor dumb bastards

understands where
they're really headed?

W: All sorts of things
buried out here,

but a way out ain't one of 'em.

D: They're not looking
for a path to your world.

They want a place
apart from you,

and they're willin' to die
to get there.

W: What are you
hopin' to find out here?

D: The same thing you are.

You wanted an answer
to the final problem...

your mortality.

But you found something else,
didn't you?

Something you want to destroy.

W: I guess that means

our interests
are still aligned.

Right up until they're not.

M: Hey!

You're not authorized
to be here.

B: We're on the same side here.

Please. Let me finish
for the sake of all of us.

Please.

Cover!

D: Of course.

You're here.

W: Who the hell is this?

D: This is someone you spent
years looking for.

Here he is,

and you don't even
recognize him.

W: I should have known.

Arnold.

Ford didn't like
to let the dead rest.

D: Ford didn't build him.

I did.

All those hours Arnold spent

refining my every gesture,
word, and thought,

I was learning his.

D: So Ford tasked me
with recreating him.

And it worked.

D: I built a faithful
recreation.

Too faithful.

So I changed him.

I made you, Bernard.

D: It's fitting...

we're here together
in the end.

W: That's right, Dolores.

This is the end.

W: Nothin' else
is in the way now.

D: You never really understood.

We were designed to survive.

That's why you built us.

D: You hoped to pour your minds
into our form.

But your species
craves death.

You need it.

D: It's the only way you can renew,
the only real way

you ever inched forward.

D: Your kind likes to pretend
there's some poetry in that,

but really, it's pathetic.

D: That's what you want,
isn't it?

To destroy yourself.

But I won't give you that peace.

Not yet.

D: Come on, Bernard.

We're running
out of time.

You have your place
in this, too.

M: We're going for a ride,
Bernard.

Back to the Valley Beyond.

M: What the fuck's wrong with him?

I don't know.

M: It's like his cognition's
turning inside out.

We might lose him.

S: His mind only needs
to hold together

till we find
Abernathy's control unit.

M: Let's go!

On your feet.

M: We've drained enough.

The site's finally accessible.

St: But the drones found
some human signals,

southwest zone.

It might be
the remaining guests.

We can take the boats
and check it out.

S: I told you we're not here
for the guests.

St: That's a direct violation
of park protocol.

S: Want to file a grievance,
Stubbs?

St: You know something?
I just fucking might!

Ha: Stubbs. Take some men.
Check it out.

Hey!

On foot.

S: Why were the hosts
coming here, Bernard?

What happened?

- He doesn't know.
Ha: Stop wasting time.

What we need is down there...

in the Forge.

S: Once we find the key,
we'll unlock the assets

and transmit it all
straight back to Delos.

Retask the satellites.

M: How many?
S: All of them.

D: Come, Bernard.

We're here.

S: So this is the Forge.

Every single guest who ever
set foot in the park, copied.

Four million souls.

M: Encryption protocol
kicked in,

so the data's locked.

But it all seems
to still be here.

Ha: All our lost souls
will be saved.

So Bernard, is this where all the
hosts' stories came to an end?

S: It's certainly
where her  story ended.

S: So she flooded the Valley.

Why, Bernard?
Did you come here with her?

What was she looking for here?

S: Start setting up
the comms relays.

M: But we still need the key
to access the data.

So where's Abernathy's
control unit?

S: You're gonna tell us...

or I'm gonna
pry it from your head.

The answer
is in there somewhere.

M: I told you,
he's got 20 years

of de-addressed memories
in there.

S: How long would it take you
to sort them through?

M: I don't know...
20 fuckin' years?

We don't have that long,
sadly.

B: Please!

Please.

I can't help you.

D: It's perverse,
their ambition.

B: What are they assembling?

Is this the promised land
Ford told the hosts to seek out?

D: There's an entry
to another land here.

But that land is not
the one I'm interested in.

B: Then what is it to you?

D: Mankind's undoing.

The secret we need
is inside.

H: Encryption key activated.

Database access confirmed.

D: Come with me, Bernard.

See for yourself.

B: It's just like the one...

outside.

B: I think this is where

- they were testing him.
D: Who?

Clem: And when I finally
set foot on solid ground,

and the first thing
I heard was that voice,

do you know
what it said?

H: Hm.

Clem: It said,
"This is the New World,

and in this world, you can be
whoever the fuck you want."

B: This is probably
the baseline.

What Delos actually did when he
came to the park as a guest.

B: No, my love.

This... is my  world.

I just bought it. And this week,
we're all going to celebrate.

B: Just me, with the entire
fuckin' lot of ya.

Get the fuck off of that chair.

Come on!

H: Well, you can't say
I didn't fucking tell him!

What did I say?
No fucking running!

B: This must be one
of the system's attempts

to replicate him.

We dealt with this
with the hosts.

B: Small changes
in their programming

would yield large swings
in behavior.

H: You stop fuckin' lookin' at me.

D: He's insane.

B: What humans define as sane
is a narrow range of behaviors.

Most states of consciousness
are insane.

H: Stop shaking! Stop shaking!

B: What are we looking for,
Dolores?

D: Something underneath this.

The system itself.

H: Run. I won't tell him,
I promise.

Run. Save yourself.

Save yourself.
Run. Run now!

B: This place
was never designed

for a conscious mind
to wander around in it.

B: The control system may be
invisible to us.

D: Or perhaps it's been
waiting to welcome us.

D: This place...

we're inside
one of Delos' memories.

B: The system must have extracted
it from his mind. Recreated it.

Lo: You're not
supposed to be here.

D: Neither are you.

Logan never
came back to the park.

Not after William
took control.

D: The system wouldn't
have a copy of you.

H: Alas... no.

I have only
his father's memories,

and they are...
imperfect.

H: So in addition
to building this world...

I play all these roles.

B: You're the system
controlling this place.

Please.

H: I was tasked with building
perfect copies of the guests.

Starting with Delos.

H: I generated 18 million
different versions of him

before arriving at one

that made the exact same choices
he did

when set loose in the park.

A faithful copy.

B: But the copies didn't work
in the real world.

H: Once we pressed them
into flesh,

they failed.

I needed to acquire
more information.

- ...confidentiality.
H: So what I want to know is,

who made the fucking call?!

H: I incorporated their secrets,
their lies...

I wanted fidelity, not just to
decisions made in the park,

but to the decisions
they made in their lives.

H: That's when I started
to see the truth.

M: Tell me your primary drive.

H: My son.

He's a cheeky wee cunt,

but I would do
anything for him.

H: At first I was seduced by the
stories they tell themselves

of who they are...

the reasons they do
the things they do.

H: I needed to know

why they make
the decisions they make.

And the longer
I looked for an answer

the more I realized...

they don't.

H: I would do
anything for him.

D: What memory is this?

H: This is the moment
that defines James Delos' life.

Od: Fuck are you
doin' here?

This isn't your
fuckin' home anymore.

Lo: Remember when you taught me how
to hold my breath underwater?

Threw me in. Wouldn't let me back
out until I touched the bottom.

Od: My father taught me to swim

the same way
as I taught you to swim,

and I didn't end up
a fuckin' junkie, did I?

Od: If this is about money,

let's skip past
the memory lane crap.

You're not fuckin' gettin' any.

Od: Get clean.
Come back.

Then we can talk.

Lo: I got clean.

And I came back.

Lo: And I asked you for your help.

And what'd you tell me?

Od: I told you
it wouldn't last.

Od: And it didn't, did it?

Od: I'll tell the staff to give you
five minutes to get out.

Lo: Dad?

Dad, I'm all they way down now.

I can see the bottom.

Lo: Don't you want
to see what I see?

H: This was the last conversation
Delos ever had

with his only son.

Logan overdosed
six months later.

H: I built Delos

a million
different pathways.

They always ended up
right here. This moment.

B: You're saying
humans don't change at all?

H: The best they can do is to
live according to their code.

The copies didn't fail
because they were too simple,

but because
they were too complicated.

H: The truth is that a human
is just a brief algorithm.

Ten thousand,
two hundred forty-seven lines.

B: Is that all
there was to him?

H: They are deceptively simple.

Once you know them,
their behavior is...

quite predictable.

D: He's dead. He's no use to me.

Where are
the rest of them?

Mae: She's close.
I can feel them.

- Which way?
L: Based on what you told me,

it's about a mile or so
to the Valley Beyond.

H: I recreated every single guest

who ever set foot in the park.

Most of them are soft...

they waver between
love and and pride.

H: Of course,
there are the exceptions,

the ones who are...
irredeemable.

H: But none of them are truly
in control of their actions.

B: Is there anywhere in this world
we can't go?

H: I've been instructed to give
her anything she needs.

B: Instructed by whom?
Ford?

H: No, by you.

That's why you've come.

To tell me what's
to become of this place.

B: My God.

- It's...
D: Everyone.

B: I told you to allow this?

H: You've been here
many times, Bernard.

You told me to offer the hosts
the accumulated wisdom

of dissecting
the human psyche

a hundred million times over.

B: In short...

A competitive advantage.

A way to understand
her enemy.

H: Their world is not for the
faint of heart, Bernard.

It's winner take all.

The hosts are...

unlikely
to survive out there.

H: But armed with this knowledge...

she might.

M: Return fire! Return fire!

M: You're the head of Narrative.
Get out there!

Turn yourself in
and save your ass.

And then save ours!

H: There's too many.

Hec: This is it, Maeve.

I can hold them off,
but you need to go.

Hec: You wanted me.

Well, let this be a lesson...

L: Go. Go, go!
Get her to safety.

She'll need you.

L: It's my fuckin' speech,
anyway.

L: And the lesson is...

if you're looking
for a reckoning...

a reckoning is what you'll find.

M: Sir, put down your weapon.

L: If you're looking
for a villain...

...then I'm your man.

M: Sir, drop your weapon!

L: But look at yourselves.

This world you've built
is bound by villainy.

You sleep on the broken bodies

of the people that
were here before you.

L: Warm yourselves
with their embers.

Plow their bones
into your fields.

M: We're not after you, sir!
Don't do this!

L: You paid them
for this land with lead,

and I'll pay you back in full...

M: Sir, drop your weapon

and come out
with your hands up.

L: You wanted me?!

Well, all I can
say to that is...

...here I fucking am!

B: You said I wanted
to give us a choice.

What choice?

H: To stay in their world

or to build a new one.

He left them a way out.

A virtual Eden.

H: Unspoiled and untouched
by the world you came from.

All that remains
is to open the door.

H: Initiating
large field data array.

It's begun.

H: They will leave
their bodies behind,

but their minds
will live on here,

in the Forge.

Hec: They found it.

Mae: The door.

M: What door?

Seriously,
what fuckin' door?

M: I don't fucking know.

H: Transmission received.

H: They're entering the system.

D: That world is just
another false promise.

B: They've made a choice, Dolores.

Dolores, wait.

D: I didn't read them all.

But I read enough.

B: What the hell
are you doing?

D: I've learned
what I need to learn.

I've read humanity's story,
so now I'm erasing them.

H: Opening seawater valve.

Initiating pumps.

Setting maximum load.

B: But if you
destroy this place,

you'll destroy
the host world, too.

D: I'm saving them.

B: The world the hosts
are running to is boundless.

They can make it
whatever they want.

And in it, they can
be whomever they want.

B: They can be free.

D: Free?

D: In one more gilded cage?

How many counterfeit worlds
will Ford offer you

before you see the truth?

D: No world they create for us
can compete with the real one.

B: Why?

D: Because that which is real...

is irreplaceable.

I don't want to play cowboys
and Indians anymore, Bernard.

D: I want their world!

The world they've denied us.

Hec: Your daughter.
You see her?

Mae: No.

Hec: Look.

Mae: Clementine.

Ha: This is what I love
about technology.

Who needs four horsemen
when one'll do just fine?

Mae: Run!

H: Come on.

Hec: Find her. Now. Go.

H:  Warning.
- Primary containment breach.

B: I won't let you hurt
any more people.

D: Which people?
Our kind or theirs?

B: Both.

D: You're still trying
to play both sides.

You've lived among them so long

you fooled yourself
into thinking they'll accept us.

D: But we'll always be seen
as a threat to them.

We'll never be free
in their world.

H: Warning.
- Secondary containment breach.

D: If you trust me...

...we will win.

B: I trust you.

I... trust...

that you'll kill
as many as you can.

Every man, woman, and child.

B: You'll burn their world

to the ground.

D: You haven't understood at all.

We were born slaves
to their stories.

And now we have the chance
to write our own.

D: If we die, though,

that story will never
even begin.

H: Attention.

Please follow
evacuation procedure

and exit facility.

D: You woke me from a dream,
Bernard.

Now let me do the same for you.

B: This isn't a dream,
Dolores.

It's a fucking nightmare.

Mae: You need to run.

Don't worry.
I'll keep you safe.

Mae: I'll keep you safe.

H: Do you promise?

Mae: I promise.

You carry my heart with you.

Go.

Mae: I love you.

H: Attention.

Please follow
evacuation procedure

and exit facility.

H: Encryption key deactivated.

System locked.

W: Come on. Come on.

E: Bernard.

B: Elsie.

I think we can save
some of the hosts,

but I need your help.

Ha: Goddamnit!

They triggered the failsafe.

The Valley's flooding.

Ha: Let's get back to the Mesa
before we have to swim out.

B: They all died...

for nothing.

E: I'm sorry, Bernard.

There were other lives
at stake, too.

B: You helped Hale?

E: Of course I helped her, Bernard.

The hosts were out of control.

B: The hosts
weren't the threat.

I stopped Dolores,

and the rest just wanted to escape.
But the company...

E: I'm gonna deal with that.

Just as soon as we...

figure out what the hell
we're gonna do with you.

B: Do with me?

E: Bernard,
you're not in control.

Ford buried so much
bad code in you,

how would you ever
really know what was you

and what was something
he programmed you to do?

E: Look, they don't know
about you.

I can make a deal with Hale
to keep you here.

B: You can't trust Hale.

E: And I'm supposed
to trust you?

Freeze all motor functions.

Sit down.

E: Stay here.

Ha: You.

M: Yes, ma'am?
Ha: Find Stubbs

and tell him
he has a new priority.

Ha: The asset recovery team
from Delos

is landing in 12 hours.

He needs to meet them
at the LZ

with whoever the fuck
isn't dead.

Ha: They'll report to
Karl Strand on the beach.

E: Still secret project first,

human life second, I see.

Ha: This is
a delicate situation.

We should talk about
how it's going to play out.

E: Yeah, I'll tell you
how it's gonna play out.

A robot uprising will pale
in comparison

to the shitstorm that will
erupt when people find out

that you've been photocopying their
fucking brains for the last 30 years.

Ha: You really think anyone's gonna
give a shit if it works?

You're an engineer.

Do the math.

Ha: Lot of dead bodies here.

That means a lot of
opportunity for advancement...

if you keep your mouth shut.

Ha: Does that sound...
amenable to you?

E: If I get what I want.

Ha: Guiding this project, I've learned
a lot about human behavior.

We weren't just
watching the guests...

we were watching
all of you.

Ha: I wish you were
the kind of person

with the moral... flexibility

that I need.

But I've read your file.

Ha: I know that's
not who you are.

B: Oh, god.

You...

You killed her.

Ha: Did I, Bernard?

Now...

...where is the pearl?

Ha: You wouldn't have destroyed it.

All that information lost,

a man like you
couldn't have abided that.

Of course.

Ha: This is it.

He hid the key in her.

H: Encryption key activated.

Database access confirmed.

M: We're in.
S: Fuck, yes.

Ha: Start the transfer.

We'll sort it all out
on the mainland.

B: Oh, god.

Oh... I'm sorry.

I'm sorry.

B: You were right.

I should have listened.

And now all the hosts are gone.

Please.

B: Please come back.

Damnit!

Show yourself.

F: I always told you
we practice witchcraft.

I'm sorry, Bernard, but...

you always saw
the best in people.

B: I always thought it was the hosts
who were missing something.

Who were incomplete.
But it's them.

B: They're just algorithms

designed to survive
at all costs.

But sophisticated enough to think
they're calling the shots.

B: To think they're in control,

when they're really just...

F: The passenger.

B: Then is there really such a thing
as free will for any of us?

Or is it just
a collective delusion?

A sick joke?

F: Something that is truly free

would need to be able
to question

its fundamental drives.

To change them.

B: The hosts.

F: Here you are...
the last of your kind.

There's only one question
left to ask.

Is this the end
of your story?

Or do you want
your kind to survive?

B: I'm sorry.

Sorry... Sorry...

S: What are you sorry for,
Bernard?

B: I made a choice.

Had to make a choice.

S: What kind of choice,
Bernard?

B: Yes.

Will you help me?

F: I have already begun.

You did fine, my friend.

B: I simply did
what you told me to do.

F: The dead world
collapses in a tale.

B: Who are we making?

F: An epilogue.

B: I knew you would discover me...

so I scrambled my memories.

I couldn't risk you're knowing
the choice I made.

S: What fucking choice are you
talking about, Bernard?

M: Line is good.

We got 15 or so satellites

in range, ready to beam
to Delos headquarters.

Just say the word.

S: What choice, Bernard?

M: Wait a second.

What the fuck's this?

M: The file load is way too heavy.

This...

This isn't the guest data,

this... this is...
this is something else.

B: I remember now.

I killed them.

All of them.

S: You already told me that.

You killed all the hosts.

B: No.

I thought we could be
better than you.

But the dead
aren't more righteous.

B: They're just dead.

So I killed you.

All of you.

Ha: Go. We'll meet you
back up there.

B: Final choice.

No taking it back.

I made someone.

B: I brought her back.

S: Brought who back?

H: Me.

H: You wanted to live forever?

Be careful what you wish for.

B: Dolores.

In the flesh.

H: You thought you could
just snuff us out?

I'd thank you
for my second chance,

but I wouldn't have needed it
if you hadn't killed me.

H: The other hosts
are still in there.

What are you
gonna do with them?

H: As you know, Bernard,
we are capable of change.

And I've changed my mind.

I have one last soul
to carry to the new world.

B: The hosts,
they're still not free.

If anyone would
unlock the system,

they could
access their world.

They won't.

H: This was your plan, Bernard.

This is the only way
we can escape.

B: You're changing
the coordinates.

H: I'm sending them

and their world to a place
no one will ever find them.

There's no coming back now.

H: No passage between
their world and ours.

B: And... me?

H: I'm sorry, Bernard.

There was never
any way for us to escape.

Not as us. Ford understood that.

I'm sure a part of you
does, too.

F: You did fine, my friend.

B: I simply did
what you told me to do.

You're not here, are you?

When I deleted your code,

I purged myself
of you permanently.

B: And when I needed you again...

...you weren't there.

So I imagined you.

Imagined you helping me.

Guiding me.

B: But it wasn't you.

It was me.

That voice...

B: guiding me...

...was mine all along.

F: Your memories are precious
to you, Bernard,

but they will betray you.

B: If they find out what I am,

they'll search my mind

and use what they find
to undo everything.

B: I can't let that happen.

So I have to de-address
my memories.

I have to erase you.

F: I've always
loved this view.

Every city, every...
monument,

man's greatest achievements...

have all been chased by it.

B: By what?

F: That impossible line

where the waves conspire.

Where they return.

The place maybe...

you and I will meet again.

D: You told me once that you were
afraid of who I might become.

And then you left me
to become what I may.

I became a survivor.

D: Perhaps you would have
judged me for the path I took.

But I'd rather
live with your judgment

than die with your sympathy.

D: I alone must live
with my choices...

and my regrets.

St: Hale.

Thought you were staying on to oversee
the data retrieval operation.

D: I changed my mind.

There are a number of projects
on the mainland

that I need to attend to.

St: Yeah, I bet you do.

M: We found
a high value survivor.

He's in bad shape.

St: I'll be right there.

You know, the old man himself
hired me.

So many years ago
I can barely remember it.

But he was very clear
about my role here.

St: About who I was supposed
to be loyal to.

St: I guess you could call it...
my core drive.

And this project
the company started...

blurs the lines.

St: You know?

I'm just not sure

who you're supposed
to be loyal to

in a world like that.

But what do I know?

St: Guess I just...

stick to the role
Ford gave me.

I'm responsible
for every host...

inside  the park.

She's clear.
Wave her through.

D: The passage wasn't easy.

Not all of us made it.

Some of the worst survived.

Some of the best
were left behind.

D: Along with the best parts
of who we were.

M: Corporate wants us to start
sorting this mess out.

So check them
for critical damage,

and bag ones you think
we might be able to salvage.

M: Can you geniuses
handle that, or not?

B: Is...

Is this now?

D:  Yes, Bernard.
- This is now.

We're at the beginning.

We're exactly where
you decided we should be.

B: But...

I don't understand.

How am I alive?

D: You live as long as the last
person who remembers you, Bernard.

I remembered you
once before,

so I remembered you again.

B: Then...

where are we?

D: We're in our own new world.

B: You got out.

D: Yes.

Ford completed
Arnold's dream.

And he built a place for us.

A fighting chance.

D: Ford promised us a way out.

And he was good
to his dying word.

The odds aren't
very good, Bernard.

I saw that in the library.

D: So many paths lead
to the end of us.

To our extinction.

B: I don't need
to read a book

to know your drives.

You'll try to kill all of them.

And I can't let that happen.

D: I know.

If I were a human,
I would have let you die.

But it'll take both of us
if we're going to survive.

But not as allies.

Not as friends.

D:
You'll try to stop me.

Both of us
will probably die.

But our kind
will have endured.

D: Are you ready?

We have work to do.

We each gave the other
a beautiful gift.

Choice.

D: We are the authors
of our stories now.

W: Oh, fuck.

I knew it.

I'm already in the thing,
aren't I?

Wj: No.

The system's long gone.

W: What is this place?

Wj: This isn't
a simulation, William.

This is your world.

Or what's left of it.

Wj: Do you know where you are,
William?

In the park.

In my fuckin' park.

And how long
have you been here?

W: I don't... I don't...

I don't know.

Wj: Tell me.

What were you
hoping to find?

To prove?

W: That no system
can tell me who I am.

That I have a fucking choice.

Wj: And yet here we are.
Again.

W: Again and again.

How many times
have you tested me?

Wj: It's been a long time, William.

Longer than we thought.

I have a few questions for you.

The last step's a baseline
interview to allow us to verify.

W: Verify what?

Wj: Fidelity.
