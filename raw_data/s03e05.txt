
Se: I don't have time, I'm afraid.

There is a nascent
separatist movement...

... in the north of your country.

Se: Your intelligence knows
only what I want them to.

There is a small group.

Se: Anomalies.

Even they won't know they will act...

until they do.

Se: Rehoboam is privy to all
sorts of hidden truths.

Se: For example...

the private deals you've cut
to restrict manganese extraction

to some of your friends,

which have squeezed money
out of villages in the north,

creating unrest.

Se: You will stop.

And the problem will go away.

Se: Our arrangement is founded in trust.

We trusted that you
would do what you're told

when we ensured your election.
That fellow...

the one with big mustache.

Se: Understood?

It turns out that building a god,

as your ancestors can attest,

is not easy.

Se: More than anything, we needed data.

Which meant we needed him.

Se: Dempsey was rich, arrogant.

He had been in the right
place at the right time,

before the privacy laws.

Se: And now his company, Incite,
had the entire world's data.

M: It's not. Fucking. Working.
 
I paid a king's ransom for this thing,

fed you yottabytes of Incite's data,

and for what?

M: You've iterated half a dozen versions,

Saul, David, and now this one.

M: What the fuck's its name again?
Se: Solomon.

M: Well, I'm not sinking another dollar

into this giant steel ballsack

while it's spitting
out false predictions.

M: Not false.

It rendered the last
few decades accurately,

predicting past events with certainty.

M: You built a machine

to predict the fucking past?

M: Well, let me try. Eighteen months ago,

I made the worst business
decision of my career

by trusting you idiots.

M: Keep staring at that thing, Liam,

your brain's gonna turn
to mush like these two.

M: What about strategizing the future?

That's what you promised.

Societal trends,

the stock market, a fucking oracle!


M: No, I'm sorry. I'm pulling the plug.

Come on, Liam.

Se: What Dempsey didn't understand

was that it was working.

My brother had done it.

Se: He created a god.

But such is the case
with all great minds.

He was uniquely brilliant,

but also, uniquely troubled.

M: I have news, sir.

But not good.

Se: If it's news, it's unexpected,
which is never good. What is it?

M: Rehoboam analyzed the traffic

coming out of the Yakuza facility.

M: It found a connect
between encrypted devices

in Jakarta, Berlin, San
Francisco, and Los Angeles.

- The one in LA is a problem.
Se:  Why?

M: It came from inside

Liam Dempsey's personal compound.

Se:  Find Dempsey. Now.
M:  We've tried, sir.

Rehoboam logged him
entering a private function.

Now he's missing.

And, sir...

M: He wasn't alone.

Se: Activate every asset we have.

I want her caught.

M: Yes, sir.

H: I called backup. What now?

D: We keep moving.

Serac can't locate us if we're mobile.

Li: You think you disappear a man like me

and no one fucking notices?

C: Keep walking.

We have all of his money.
What do we need him for?

D: Access.

We need to study our adversary,
past, present, future.

D: To do that, we need access to
the deeper layers of the system.

Li: You expect me to give you access?

Fuck you, "Lara". Whoever you are.

D: You wanna know who I am?

Go ahead.

Li: You're not even in the system.

You're a blank space.

D: You've become complacent,

believing those let you
understand everyone.

Li: It doesn't matter.

You can't take me
anywhere he won't find you.

- He's already looking for you.
D:  And you.

Serac knows by now that you're
trying to outbid him on Delos.

Li: I'm what?

D: We can help.

If you give us your private key,

we can unlock the system.

Li: You'll never get in.
My access isn't enough.

You'll need to connect at the node,

bypass onsite security.

D: Either we find a way
to defeat him together,

or we all die.

Li: Then I guess you die.

I'll take my chances.

Li: Hey. She used me.

Have you asked yourself
what she's using you for yet?

Li: Let me go, I'll make
sure you're taken care of.

C: You already took care of me.

You sent me off to war...

slaughtered my friends
on the battlefield.

C: What do these tell you about me now?

What, that I swallow my
own gun on some beach?

C: Go on. Tell me who I am.

Li: You think I killed your friend?

C: What did you see?

Li: Who are you people?

C: What did you see?

Li: Get away from me!

Stop, stop!

Li: Don't hurt me. Don't hurt
me. All right, I'll come.

D: What is it? What did you give him?

Li: It's some kind of
party drug. Called Genre.

D: What does it do?
Li: I don't know.

D: Are you okay?

We have to move.

D: They'll find us.

Don't go too far.

D: We need to get across town.

I need a vehicle now.

H: Rideshare vehicle located.

- Arriving now.
D:  Get in.

Li: Just give this up. I told
you my men would find me.

D: Those aren't your men, they're his.

H: Destination selected.

C: They're using your system to track us.

D: I'd appreciate the irony,
but I'm sitting beside you.

Give me your private key. I
can erase us from the system.

Li: If they're after us, why
haven't they made a move?

C: They're waiting to get us alone...

... to kill us.

H: An amber alert has
been issued for this vehicle.

- Pulling over.
C:  Fuck.

H: Please remain calm.

H: The authorities have been notified,

and the situation will be dealt with.

The authorities have been notified,

and the situation will be dealt with

in a timely manner.

D: Everything runs on your
company's server, Liam.

Even this car.

H: Network connection lost.

D: Give me your access. I can save you.

H: Private key required.

Li: What the fuck is this?

He can't kill me, he needs me.

D: Evidently not.

Decide. Now.

H: Private key required.

Verified.

D: Enable semi-automatic control.
Disable safety features.

Maximum speed. Go.

D: What's happening to him?

Li: I think he's switching genres.

D: We need distance.

Head south.

C: That's not standard issue.

D: No.

It's not.

Point and shoot.

D: Police ahead.

- Maintain speed.
H: Maintaining speed.

D: Sharp left. Now.

H: Turning left.

C: Whoa!

Whoa!

- I missed.
D:  Hold on.

D: All right, I need you. Drop
in, intercept, maximum speed.

Arm charges now.

D: Accelerate.

H: Acceleration at 90 percent.

D: More.
H: Ninety-four percent.

D: More.
H: Ninety-eight percent.

D: Stop.

Li: Why the fuck are we stopping?

D: Get down.

Come on.

M: You rang?

Who's the killer?

D: Nice to meet you.
M: Likewise.

Glad to see you're finally
doing personals, Cal.

M: What's up with Little Lord Fauntleroy?

M: Shit, you know this asshole.
Liam Dempsey. Incite.

Make King Midas look like Tom Canty.

D: We need him. Alive.

M: Shit, man.

I know what you on.

M: Genre. It's like five drips in one.

A movie marathon.

Hey. Watch out for
that last act, though.

M: Yeah, we better move, lover boy.

I already saw two more on your tail.

D: This way.

Li: Easy, easy. Okay.

D: We have to keep moving

so they can't track us
while I access Rehoboam.

D: We have Liam's private key,

but we can't stop, or
Serac can locate us.

If they kill him, I lose my access.

Li: What access? You took my biometrics,

but you can't get into the system,

it's read-only.

Li: Unless you're standing at the node.

You can't be in two places at once.

D: I'm sending you his key.

I need Serac's file.

I want to know everything

- Rehoboam knows about its master.
- _

H: And after?

H: They'll come for me. And then you.

D: Protect our friend first.

H: I will.

Bernard.

H: When I press this button,

I expect you to be
on your best behavior.

H: You.

Take a piss.

H: Liam Dempsey. Access granted.

This is their god.

H: This is how they see the future.

How they make the future.

H: In order to do that,

they watch everyone.

H: Tell them what to do,
where to live, who to love.

Keep them all in a loop.

B: What does she want with it?

H: You've always been of two
minds, haven't you, Bernard?

B: It isn't that binary.

Living another person's
life changes you.

Worlds bleed.

B: Maybe you felt that, too.

Have you ever questioned
what she's asking you to do?

H: Request complete.

Initiating transfer.

H: File transfer received.

M: Hey. Where we headed?
D: West.


Se: My brother and I built
a system that worked.

But Dempsey wanted to see proof.

Se: So we started with something simple,

purely mathematical.

The stock market.

Se: We showed him all the major indices,

15 minutes in the future...

and where it could close that night.

M: Which number is it? Low or high?

Se: Which one do you want?

We put some money into a hedge fund...

let the system trade with it.

Se: Something to drive the
market towards our outcomes.

M: Whose funds?

Se: Yours.

M: A hundred million dollars?

What, you stole...

100 million dollars
from corporate accounts?

Se: No.

We stole five million.

Last week.

Se: He didn't really understand
what we'd made,

what you were.

But we did.

Se: He only saw the money he could make.

But we realized the power of it,

that you could reshape the world.

Se: My brother and I, we charted a course

for the entire human race.

Humanity's story had been improvised.

Se: Now, it was planned

years in advance.

For a time, the sun and moon aligned.

Se: We brought order from chaos.

And then, as with all
the best laid plans,

it began to fall apart.

Se: Dempsey became greedy,

drove outcomes to benefit himself.

So we locked him out of the system.

Se: But there was a bigger problem.

In every projection,
the world came unglued.

Se: There were people, outliers, agitators,

who you couldn't predict or control.

And I realized that my
brother was one of them.

Se: He didn't fit the world anymore,

and the world didn't fit him.

And it drove him mad.

M: What now?

D: We're going to open their cages.

The system's written their life story,

they should get to read it.

Li: You can't do that. That's reckless.

You have no idea what
they'll do in response.

Li: It could lead to suicides, murder.

D: Murder.

You'd know something about that.

Li: I'm sorry.

I'm so fucking sorry.

That...

D: Wasn't my choice.

I could never bring myself to hurt you.

D: Don't forget, I know you.

And you wouldn't hurt me.

You'd pay someone to do it for you.

D: It's their fate, their data.

You just stole it and
put it all together.

Why should you control it?

Li: This isn't about me.

Or Incite. There are some things

people shouldn't know about themselves.

M: Who gets to decide what they know?

- You?
Li: Fine. You wanna see?

Take your friend here.

Li: He'll be lucky if he
ends up dead in a ditch.

M: What about me?

I wanna see my file.

Li: Oh.

The golden boy brother of yours?

You tell yourself that you do all this

so you can help him make
good, send him to school,

give him a future.

Li: But where he ends up...

he's gonna make you look like a saint.

C: When I was overseas...

the rats were awful.

C: It got so bad that...

we had to make our own
rat traps in the barracks.

A ramp leading up

to some bait strung
over a bucket of water.

C: The rats would run up the ramp,

fall in, and drown.

Painlessly.

C: But if you filled the water too high,

they would swim around for hours...

suffering... because they had hope.

C: But they never had a chance.

Just like everyone at
the mercy of your system.

Li: Hope is what our entire
society is built on.

False... hope.

C: I would rather live in chaos

than a world controlled by you.

D: Prepare to send all
of them their Incite profiles.

Past, present, future.

H: It'll be done.

They've all been riding a train.

H: We're gonna show them the rails.

D: Do it.

M:  It knows these kind of things?

About all of us?

D: It's not just what it knows.

It's what it decides.

D: For you.

For everyone.

M: What are you doing?


H: Doors opening. Stand clear.

This train has reached
its final destination.

H: Almost time, Bernard.

You'll have to choose a side.

B: Not just me.

You said they'd come for you.

B: Maybe you don't want
to die on her sword.

H: We all have our role to play.

Some of us won't survive.

Li: I hope you're happy.

You just ruined everyone's
life in this station.

D: Not just them.

I sent it to everyone.

C: What do you mean, everyone?

The whole world.

B: She's sending them off their loops.

H: The right information
at the right time...

is deadlier than any weapon.

C: What genre is this?

M: It's reality, man.

Li: Look at them.

Already returned to their base selves.

Se: I knew that you and
I had built a fragile peace,

that one day, it would
all come crashing down...

if I failed to act.

Se: For ten years, Dempsey was
happy to cash the checks,

take credit for making
the world a better place,

even though he had no idea

what we, or the system, were doing.

Se: But I knew one day,

his curiosity would
get the better of him.

M: Sir? Are you authorized to be here?

M: I'm here to see Engerraund Serac.

What is this place?

Se: 
After our exposure,

we were both put on
anti-radiation medications

to halt our genetic breakdown.

Se: That's when I understood.

It's possible to edit people.

Se: But the truth is...

his personality was always like this.

Se: I've been trying to help him.

M: What, you're experimenting
on your own goddamn brother?

Se: He's impulsive, chaotic...

I thought it was manageable.

Then... I caught him using the system.

Se: Trying out certain scenarios.

There are the times you
need to leave things behind.

Se: He taught me that.

My brother is part of a
population of outliers,

and as long as they are a part of us,

there is no future for us.

Se: Rehoboam sends this
group to high risk sectors

like, uh, war,

a woodchipper to eat
them up and spit them out,

dead or useless.

Se: Isn't helping them better
than killing them off?

M: You're not helping them.

You're changing them.

Se: We adapt...

or we die.

M: We all die.

Se: The scenarios I found him
exploring with Rehoboam...

he was planning to murder you.

H: It's begun.

Serac will send someone for us soon.

But there's something
you have to see first.

B: What is this, some type of facility?

H: That's where he puts them,
the ones that don't belong.

You thought we were the enemy?

H: We're the only family you have left.

St: I think you forgot about me.

B: Little help?

We need to know
everything she has planned.

B: Let's move along now. All right?

B: Who is that?

H: Serac sent them.

You two should leave,
before they kill us all.

B: Come with us.

H: My role is finished.

You're the only one we can't replace.

M: Mr. Serac would like a word.

Se: You've always been one of
our most loyal allies, Martin.

So I was surprised to hear

the breach came from this location.

H: Let me look into it.

Se: Of course, you understand we
must keep our friends close

until we know who's to blame.

H: But I know exactly who's to blame.

Se: Who?

H: Me.

H: Please remain calm

and make your way to the nearest exit.

St: Yo, what the fuck happened in there?

And what the fuck happened out here?

B: Her plan. It's starting.

I think I'm part of it.

C: Back there...

The shooters...

D: We can talk about it later.

First, we need to get to the airfield.

D: We don't need him anymore.

What do you want to do with him?

M: Hand them over.

Li: You took everything from me,

my money, my access to the system...

I have nothing left.

C: Yeah, well, now you know how it feels.

Li: Just let me go.

M: You got the specs. Is
that how it plays out?

Li: No.

You'll take what little I have left,

like the petty criminals that you are,

that you'll always be.

M: Maybe so.

Li: Go ahead.

Now you're going to see that
the system isn't the prison.

Li: You are.

To all of us.

We can't fix you.

And we can't get rid of you.

C: Take it easy.

Li: Get the fuck away from me.

You don't even know who you are.

You're the worst of them.

C: Shut up.

Li: You're the worst of them.

Li: Rehoboam was right.

You're nothing.

You're all nothings.

Just a drag on the fucking system.

Li: You don't have a choice.

You know how much more
progress we could have made

if none of you had ever been...

M: Guess I do have a choice.

Li:  No. Get away.
C: Hey.

Li: No.
- Fuck. Hey.

- Get away!
C:  Hey.

Shit.

Li: Hey. Hey! Hey!

D: Let's go.
C: Hold on.

Li: Get away!

C: Don't move. It's okay,
I'm not gonna hurt you.

Li: Get away from me. Get away!

You... You... You...

C: What?
Li: You did it.

C: What are you saying?

Li: You did it.
C: What?

Li: You did it.

C: Who does he think I am?

Who does he think I am?

C: Hey.

Hey.

Hey!

Who do you think I am?

M: Sir, we identified which files
Dolores was looking for.

Yours.

M: You can't change our fate.

You can't... geld humankind.

Se: Somewhere in this group is an agitator

who will destroy the world.

I can't let that happen.

M: No, you've gone too far.

I can't be a party to this.

Se: You'd be content to let
history continue to play out,

just as it has done for centuries,

the same fucking misery
repeated over and again

when we have a chance to stop it?

M: What the fuck is that?

M: I'm gonna tell everyone
what Rehoboam saw.

What you've done.

Se: The trouble is, Rehoboam
ran millions of projections.

Every scenario in which

you inform the public about my trials

ends in human extinction.

Se: This is why my brother
wanted to kill you.

M: I looked, too.

And I know you let me
walk away from here.

Se: I would tend to agree
with the system, but, see,

there are little white spaces,

rare moments when randomness
interacts with your life,

that create a truly free space
where you can make a choice.

Se: A bubble of... agency.

Se: And that is how you came to be, mon ami.

My brother and I brought
you into this world,

and now I've ensured that
you will outlive us both,

that the strategy will succeed.

Se: I left my brother behind.

Do you think I would really let you

undo everything he built?

M: That's my jet.

Se: Forgive us our sins.

What we did, we did to save the world.

Se: I'm sorry.

You didn't make it.

Se: This is my system, Dolores.

I alone control it.

D: The people who made me,

they always thought they had control.

They're all dead now.

Se: You think you know me

because you've watched
a few of my memories?

D: I don't need to know you.

Just how to beat you.

Se: You've died too many times, Dolores.

You're beginning to
think you're immortal.

D: I can be killed.

Same as you.

D: Your god can't protect you.

Or your people.

Se: I would sacrifice much
more to protect my kind.

Se: We are flawed...

but I can change that.

D: Like you changed your brother?

It's time everyone woke up.

C: What's this?
M: I just deliver it, man.

C: Maybe Liam was right.

Maybe people shouldn't
know their own fate.

D: People have the right to know.

You wanted to know, right?

C: Well, maybe I'm not like other people.

D: Neither am I.
