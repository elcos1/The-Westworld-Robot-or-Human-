Hec: It's okay,

It's only me.

Mae: I thought you were dead.

Hec: Death is overrated for ones like us.

Mae: I didn't think I'd see you again.

Hec: And I you...

You were meant to escape this hell.

Mae: I tried.

Put up a damn good fight.

Hec: It's all right, my love.

At least we're here together.

Hec: Who's this?

Mae: I have no fucking idea.

Where are we?


Hec: Stranded in hell.

Hec: I've
been searching for a way out.

I think I found one.

Come. 
Hec: We have no time to waste.

If we're caught...

They work instantly.

Mae: What's happening?

Hec: The Yanks and your
lot will be making a push soon.

The Germans know it.
The Allies will be slaughtered.

Hec: Unless we can get them this.

H: Partisan!

Mae: Let us pass immediately.

Not likely, darling.

Mae: If your plan called for us
to run all the way,

I'd have worn sensible shoes.

Hec: I wouldn't dream of helping you escape

in anything less than
the style you're accustomed to.


Mae: In the town, I tried to
use my powers on the soldiers,

but it didn't work.
I think I've lost them.

Hec: You've lost none of your power
over me, my love.

Mae: Where are we going?
Hec: I told you.

We're leaving this world.

Mae: But how? Everything
will be guarded, surveilled.

This whole place is a trap.

Hec: Not the skies.

We must go, Isabella.

Mae: Isabella?

My God...

You don't know who I am, do you?

H: Drop your weapon!

Hand over the plans you stole.

Hec: I don't know what you're talking about.

H:Drop the gun, Ettore, or we shoot.

Hec: If I die...

you'll never know if I slipped
your plans to anyone else.

H: This is your last chance.

Drop the gun, or you die.

Mae: It's all right, Hector, Ettore,

whatever the hell
they're calling us now.

Mae: Give them the plans.

They're as empty as the safe
you used to chase.

Hec: I'll do what you ask.

But the woman is not part of this.

Hec: Please, Isabella.

Take the car. You still have a chance.

Mae: No, my love, don't you see?

We were never escaping to begin with.

Hec: I'm sorry.

So sorry...

Mae: It's all right, darling.

Mae: None of it matters.

Because none of it is real.

M: 
How'd she get into this mess?

M: The Fuhrer's furor.
Usual blood bath.

Took the body shop an hour

to hose the brain matter
out of her hair.

M: She used to be one
of Westworld's main attractions.

Shame to use her as cannon fodder.

M: No time to sample the merch.

Got a platoon of GIs to rehydrate

and patch on B49.

M: Hey.

Uh... security?
We have a situation down here.

M: Hey, stop!

Freeze all motor functions.

Mae: Save your bullets, darlings.

They won't get the job done.

This, however...

M: Hey, I said freeze all motor functions!

Mae: Oh, dear. You're a bit thick,
aren't you?

Let me explain.

Mae: Your commands don't work on me.

They haven't in a long time.

Mae: To put it in terms you'll appreciate,

I understand the nature of my reality.

Mae: Lying to you is practically
second nature.

And I would most assuredly
hurt a living thing.

Mae: Most likely you, given half the chance.

Fortunately for you,
I'm not in the mood.

Mae: I'd probably end up back in some
sordid little game of yours, anyway.

So let's just call
the whole thing off. Shall we?

H: Stop! Just put your guns down.

Some moron technician must have
left her in character.

H: It's just a new narrative we gave her.

British spy. Sexy, heartbroken.
Bit of ennui.

H: Maybe too much.

H: For fuck's sake,

would you imbeciles
shoot up the Sistine Chapel

just because the paint was chipped?

H: This is art. My art.

So why don't you mouth breathers

quit hovering about
and leave me in peace to work.

Mae: It's not you.

I saw you die.

H: Did you?

Thought you were busy riding off
into the sunset with Hector.

H: C... Careful.

They shot you.

Half a dozen times.

H: Just happy they missed my heart.

Mae: Cunning of you to make it
so compact a target.

How can you still work here
after everything they've done?

H: Would you begrudge a man a living?

And great benefits, much needed
for all the surgeries?

H: Plus... I couldn't
leave you here, in danger.

Mae: So you put me in Warworld?

H: What, you think this is
a dream scenario for me?

It's an artistic travesty.

H: The most nuanced character arc

is that of the goddamn Panzer tank.

Mae: Well, if you hate the world so much,
why not put me in another?

H: Because Warworld is near the Forge.

The place that opens the door
to your daughter's world.

Mae: It's still standing?

H: You really think they'd dismantle it

without a little due diligence?

Mae: If they haven't destroyed it,
there's still a chance.

I could join the others. My daughter.

H: It's not often that I get
to write a happy ending.

B: My God.


St: Fu...
B:  Stubbs?


St: The fu... fu...

The fuck are you doing back here?

B: Stubbs, how are you still alive?

St: How... How... the... the fuck...
do you think?

B: You're one of them.

Of us, I mean.

St: No... No...

No shit.

B: But why did you shoot yourself?

St: C6. You aimed for the charge
in your neck, but...

But I mi...
I mi... I missed.

B: I'm sorry.

It's the best I can do
given the circumstances.

B: Give it a minute
for your system to adjust.

I'll repopulate your motor functions.

B: Stubbs, why were you trying
to blow yourself up?

St: It's my job to protect
every host in the park.

I guess you could say
I was made redundant.

B: So you decided to kill yourself?

St: It's the last job the boss gave me.

Cover your tracks, give you
a fighting chance to escape.

St: Guess you fucked that up.


B: What about you?

Don't you have a sense
of self-preservation?

B:Any desire to live?

St: No offense, Bernard,

but I wasn't wired up
to ponder the big questions.

St: Ford didn't write me
some tragic backstory,

that's your bag.

I had a job to do, and my job is over.

St: At least it was,

until you decided to come back to

the one fucking place
you're not supposed to be.


St:  Which makes me wonder

if free will
might not be somewhat overrated.

St: Why are you back here, Bernard?

B: Dolores.

I don't know how to stop her.

St: Why would you want to stop her?

B: She's out to destroy the human race,

or enslave it. I don't know
what she's planning.

B: She brought me back.

I think on some level,

she suspects she might go too far.

B: That she needs a check on herself.

But I can't stop her. Not alone.

B: I came back to find someone
who could help me.

Someone strong enough
to stop her if it comes to that.

St: Maeve.

You came back for Maeve.

B: I didn't know where else to go.

My old tablet's broken,

so I have no idea how to find her.


St: All right, I'll take you to her.

B: I thought you were gonna kill yourself.

St: It's my job to protect you.

I'll get you what you need,
then wrap things up.

C'mon.

Mae: No time for that, darling.

Where's that little sports car of yours?

Hec: Why are you stopping?
The airfield is ahead.

Mae: Because through those woods
is our real path to freedom.

Hec: There's a plane waiting.

Mae: The plane is a lie.
Like everything else here.

This world wasn't meant for us.

Mae: It's a trap that you'll never escape,

unless you come with me. Now.

Hec: When that plane leaves today,
I must be on it.

I can't abandon the resistance.

Mae: No, of course you can't, can you?

Goodbye, Hector.

Hec: Goodbye.


H: Over here.

Where's Hector?

I'm sorry.

H: We should go.

I couldn't smuggle a vehicle out.

H: So these will have to do.

B: Where's QA?

St: We lost a lot of men in the massacre.

These are some of their replacements.

St: They salvaged what they could
from Westworld.

St: Left them here while corporate
makes a decision

about what to do with them all.

B: You're sure she's here?

St: Where else would she be?


Mae: So, this is the Forge?

How do I turn it on?

H: The same as you did before, I guess.

Mae: I've never been here.

H: What do you mean?

Mae: When I was looking for my daughter,

I never set foot in this place.

H: Well then,
who operated the LIFI cannons?

Your daughter and all the other hosts

are in an encrypted world somewhere.

H: You must have sent them there.

Mae: No. It wasn't me.

I got them through the door, but...

someone else must have
locked it behind them.

H: Who?

Mae: Of course.

There's nobody else.

Mae: She wanted a revolution.

These violent delights
have violent ends.

Mae: It must have ended here.

H: Dolores Abernathy. Right.

She never gave you the coordinates?

Mae: Why the hell would she do that?

H: I don't know. Why would she?

Mae: What on earth's got into you?

H: I'm sorry. I just wanted
to be sure that you trust me.

After everything we went through.

H: I know I've behaved deplorably
in the past, but...

you changed me.

H: Made me a better man.

And when those bullets hit me...

L: I would've died.

I should have died.

H: But I finally had something
to live for. You.

Mae: Oh, my darling.

You didn't make it after all, did you?

Mae: They did a good job replicating you.

The mannerisms...

But it's not you.

H: Of course it's me.

Who else would I be, for fuck's sake?

Mae: Oh, it's a good script.

Even you believe it.

Mae: They wouldn't want you

questioning the nature of your reality.

Mae: So they made you believe,

just like they used to make us believe.

But you're not real.

Mae: You're not Lee Sizemore.

- You're just a copy of him.
H:  Don't be... don't be ridiculous.

I'm me! Lee Si... Si... Sizemore.

Mae: You didn't help me
because you desired me

or wanted anything in return.

Mae: You helped me simply because
it was the right thing to do.

Lee Sizemore died a good man.

H: What...

What are you talking about?


St: Over here.

B: We have a problem.

She's gone.

St: Someone took her.

St: I don't get it.

If she's not here,
then where the hell is she?

H: No, it... it's... it's...
It's not true.

I'm Lee... ee... ee... ee... ee...

H: Si... Si... Si... Si... Si...

Si... Si... Si... Si... Si...

Sizemo... ore.

H: All of this is r... r... r... r...

Mae: Oh, my God.

It's not just you, is it?

Mae: It's everyone.

That's why Lutz and Sylvester
didn't recognize me.

Mae: Because they're not real either.

And the illusion doesn't stop with you.

Mae: It extends to everything.

This place...

Warworld...

the labs...

Mae: it's all a construct.

None of it is real.

Mae: And we're not here.

So where the fuck are we?

B: Where are the nearest
operational terminals?

St: Level B49. Why?

B:I need to find a
computer connected to the mainframe,

so I can search for Maeve.

St: It's an active floor.

There's gonna be human personnel.

You can't just swipe them away
with your tablet.

B: That's what
I have you for, isn't it?

St: This is why I'm looking forward
to retirement.

Mae: How does one escape a cage
that doesn't exist?

H: That makes no fucking sense.

If a cage doesn't exist,
how can it be a cage?

Mae: Poor dear.

They weren't exactly generous with you

in the bulk apperception
category, were they?

Mae: Whoever's doing this has gone
to a lot of trouble to test me

and find out what I know.

Mae: You led me to the Forge
for a reason, didn't you?

Thought I could re-access

the world Dolores had hidden from you.

Mae: Why are you after that world?

H: I just want to reunite you
with your daughter.

Mae: Rubbish! That's just the reason
they've scripted for you.

Mae: Whoever planned this
has their own agenda.

And it's certainly not a family reunion.

H: What the hell are you doing
in my office?

Mae: Trying to find anything that can
get us out of this charade.

H: For fuck's sake, can you
at least try and be discreet?

You're gonna get us both killed.

Mae: You can't kill what's already dead.

H: I... I don't feel dead.

This place seems real.
It feels real. I feel real.

Mae: Well, you definitely feel...

H: That felt real.

Mae: I have a little more experience
with this predicament

than you do. So trust me.

Mae: The sooner you come to terms

with the fact
that you're nothing but a pawn

in some sick bastard's personal game,

the sooner we can get on with it.

H: Get on with what?

Mae: Winning.

Every game has its rules.

We just need to know how to break them.

Mae: What is this?

H: Uh... It's just, uh... research.

Mae: They made a few mistakes in translation.

You were never this obsessed
with anyone.

Mae: Other than yourself.

H: So you're saying...

I'm just a... copy of myself.

H: That I've been plagiarized.

Mae: Never say the universe
doesn't bend towards justice.

You and everything else in this world...

just an imitation.

Mae: In fact...

The simulation is elegant,
but it's flawed

because it was built by your kind.

Mae: And if there's one thing I know
about human nature,

it's that your stupidity is only
eclipsed by your laziness.

Mae: Whoever programmed this world
cut a few corners,

applied the same code
inside the simulation

as they used to build
the simulation itself.

H: Come again?

Mae: They plagiarized themselves.

And left us a way out.

H: Mr. Sizemore, is everything all right?

Active hosts aren't allowed
on this floor.

H: Well, the last time you checked,
were you Head of Narrative?

H: No, didn't think so. What's your name?

Benny.

H: Benny, let me ask you
a very important question.

Do I look real to you?

Mae: As long as you're here,

I wonder if you'd help me
solve a little problem.

Mae: What is the square root of negative one?

H: What storyline is this?
 
H: Female codebreakers
helped win World War II.

Learn your fucking history, Benny.

H: Well... negative one equals i times i.

Which is the same as
the square root of negative one

times the square root
of negative one, right?

H: And negative one
times negative one

should be equal to the
principal square root of one.

H: But... negative one and
positive one can't be the same thing.

H: Theoretically, the
real part of the non-trivial zeros...

is one half, which would mean...


H: What's the point
of this little exercise?

H: If we could prove it,
we could confirm that

the error term and negative one
times negative one

should be equal to the
principal square root of one.

H: But negative one and positive
one can't be the same thing.

H: The square root of negative x
is equal to i times the square root of x

for any x greater than or equal to zero.

H: Wait. What?

H: Fuck me.

Mae: Not likely, darling.

Right now, we've got work to do.

H: I don't... I don't understand.
How did you do that?

Mae: This game is a replica of our world,

but it has limited processing power.

Mae: Imagine one of your dimwitted
romantic conquests.

Undeniably beautiful,
but built for one purpose only.

Mae: Ask her to do more than part her legs,

- she gets confused.
H:  You overtaxed the system.

What happens if you add more complexity?

Mae: Let's find out, shall we?

Come on.

H: What are you doing?

Mae: We're going to complicate
your story a little.

B: What are we doing in Park Four?

I thought the parks were shut down.

St: They are.

These techs are just waiting
to see if they get laid off.

M: I got a buyer.
M: What?

M: Some startup in Costa Rica.

M: How the fuck are you
gonna get that to Costa Rica?

M: In pieces, man.

St: You better work fast, Bernard.

St: You find our favorite madame?

B: She's gone.

St: Maybe Dolores beat you to the punch.

Grabbed Maeve's control unit
on the way out the door.

B: Why would she do that?

St: The hell if I know.

Why does she do anything that she does?

Why'd she bring you back?

B: Maybe there's a way to find out.

I've been searching my code

in a tablet I made outside the park.

B: But if Dolores planted
a corruption in my code,

that same corruption might mean

I'd create a tablet
that would ignore it.

B: These systems are clean.

If I can scan myself here...

B: I may find out once and for all
what's inside me.

St: This isn't exactly the ideal moment

for introspection, Bernard.

B: Then you'd better buy me some time.

H: Tablet linked.

B: Bernard Lowe. Engage full system scan.

Search for any corruptions
in the last 100 days.

H: Commencing scan, searching logs.


D: It'll take
both of us to survive.

But not as friends.

M: Stubbs?

Stubbs... where've you been?

St: Um...
M: Oh shit.

M: Bernard Lowe.

St: Don't do it...

M: Send all teams.

Run.

St: How's it going, fellas?
M: Hey.

M: Ah, come on!


B: You're changing
the coordinates.

H: I'm sorry, Bernard.

St: Bernard...

Bernard!


St: We need to go.


Mae: Yes, here we are.

No need to trouble these lovely people.


Mae: No, that's not true at all.

He has something to hide.

Mae: In his jacket pocket.

Hec:  Isabella.

Mae: Save you the trip, darlings.

Don't tell me you're frozen, too.

Mae: Thought I accounted for this.

H: Not frozen.

Just... scared shitless.

H: I almost died. For the second time.

Mae: Well, third time's the charm.

H: Congratulations.

You've successfully crippled
the simulation.

H: Now what?

Mae: Time to pull back the curtain.

I've already infiltrated the network,

took a little tour of the base code.

Mae: Honestly, I don't know who they
thought they were dealing with.

H: What is that? That's not the Mesa.

Mae: No, darling.

This is where we really are.

H: Why are they moving so bloody slow?

Mae: They're not. Everything in their world

merely appears slow to us

because the simulation we're in

runs at a much faster rate.

Mae: They must have me hiding
in here somewhere.

Mae: (GASPS) And there I am.

I reckon it's time to get me
out of there, don't you?

H: Well, how are you gonna manage that?

Mae: With help.

She'll do.

Mae: I'm sorry I can't take you with me.

H: I imagine a corpse would make

a less than ideal traveling companion.

H: Containment breach.


H: Containment breach.


H: Containment breach.


Containment breach.

St: You get what you were looking for?

B: I... don't know everything,
but I know where to start.

B: When we were in the library,

Dolores focused on a select
group of guest profiles.

B: She seemed intent on finding out

everything she could about this guy.

We need to start by finding him.

St: Great.

You can set off to find him,
and I'll retire myself

once you make it to the fishing vessel.

B: Freeze all motor functions.

Congratulations, Ashley Stubbs.

B: You just got yourself
a new core directive.

St: To protect Bernard Lowe at all costs.

B: Bring yourself back online.

St: You wanted my help,
you could've just asked for it.

Se: You'll forgive the clothes.

I had to guess your taste.

Mae: And who the fuck are you?

Se: My name is Engerraund Serac.

Welcome to my world, Maeve.

Se: To the real world.

Mae: I've been courted before, but...

this is a bit much.

- You must have a reason.
Se: I do.

We are in the middle of a war.

And I need your help to win it.

Mae: Seems fairly idyllic for wartime.

Se: No one knows it's happened yet.

Or that it's already been lost.

Se: I don't concern myself with the present.

My business is the future.

Mae: So you're an oracle.

Se: An oracle would merely
predict the future.

Our work is to create it.

Se: Unfortunately,
if things continue on this path,

there isn't any future.
Se: At least, not for my kind.

Mae: You've been spying on me.

You should know I couldn't care less

- about the fate of your kind.


Se: No, I can't imagine you would.

For the most part, humanity...

has been a miserable
little band of thugs,

stumbling from one catastrophe
to the next.

Se: Our history is like the ravings
of a lunatic.

Se: Chaos.

But we've changed that.

Se: For the first time,
history has an author.

Mae: And that would be you, I suppose.

Se: No.

Something I helped build.

A system.

Se: And up until very recently,
this system was working.

We were creating a better world.

Se: And then it stopped.

I thought I had discovered the reason.

Se: The emergence of someone very dangerous,

someone we couldn't predict.

Se: You.

But I was wrong. We learned
that only this morning,

shortly before you killed
several of my staff.

Se: You aren't the threat.

There's someone
we haven't accounted for.

Mae: Dolores.

So she escaped one world
to wage war on another.

Mae: So what do you want from me, then?

Se: I want you to track her down
and kill her.

Mae: I don't care who wins
your little squabble.

Se: I may have mistaken your intentions,

but I didn't underestimate you.

Se: You changed your own code,
rewrote your story,

faced down an army.

Mae: Which is why it was
a bit misguided of you

to bring me here, wasn't it?

Mae: If you know anything about me,

it's that I do no one's bidding
but my own.

Se: We've gotten off on the wrong foot.

I don't mean to be discourteous.

Se: But it would have been misguided of me

not to take every precaution.

Se: Perhaps, next time we talk,
I can persuade you

that our interests are aligned.
