St: Bernard.

Bernard.

B: What is it?

St: We need to talk.

Strand and his team...

St: I don't think they're here
for a rescue mission.

They're not even lookin' for survivors.

B: Then what are they here for?

St: You know that, Bernard.

We both know.

St: Their fucking project.

Hale just wants to secure their
assets, and that means...

making anyone who knew
about it disappear.

St: Theresa had a satcom in her office.

If we can get to it,
we can call for help.

S: Just the men I wanted to see.

Hold back.

Let's go for a walk.

S: Move.

St: What is this?

You gonna execute us?

S: No, Mr. Stubbs.

This is a negotiation.

S: You have something I need.

A key.

And I think one of you

is hoping to sell that key
to the highest bidder.

S: And I think you've already
killed to protect yourself.

St: Killed? Killed who?
S: Theresa Cullen.

St: She died in a slip-and-fall.
It was an accident.

We found a bloom of her DNA

five kilometers from where
you found her body.

S: And that's where we're going.

S: Where she actually died.

St: Hale.

I see you've signed off on
kidnapping your own employees now.

Ha: The project is a turning point
for the human species, Stubbs.

You know that.

S: Which means you knew

how much it was worth
on the open market.

S: In one of her last
communiqu√©s with Theresa,

she said she suspected foul play.

S: I think one of you lured
her here and killed her.

You? I don't see it.

St: But you...

limited skill set...

limited prospects.

Not really... management material.

St: I've never set foot
in this place before.

I don't know a fucking thing.


B: Stop.

Something you want to tell us, Bernard?

M: Ma'am, something you should see.

Ha: I figured you'd have some skeletons
in your closet, Bernard.

I didn't think they'd be your own.

Ha: Your predicament is unique.

Ha: A host... hiding amongst the humans...

Even from himself.

Ha: Catch your breath.

St: What are you guys doing to him?

M: Right now, waterboarding him.

At least that's how he perceives it.

Ha: Analysis.

Would you ever lie to me, Bernard?

B: No, never.

Good.

Dolores Abernathy.

She led the attack here
on the Mesa, didn't she?

B: I don't remember.

Ha: But you do.

Your archives say that you were here,

which means somewhere,
the memories exist.

Ha: You can access them.

I know you can.

But maybe you don't want to remember.

So let's do this together.

Ha: I'll tell you what I saw,

and you tell me what you saw,

and we'll figure out what Dolores did

with her father's control unit.

P: You cataracts!

St: We've lost contact with
the response team.

The train wasn't an
accident, it was the hosts.

St: We should get the fuck out of here, now.

Ha: We stay until I have
what I need from him.

Send some backup to the lower levels.

M: Kit up. Six teams.

St: I'll go with.

M: You establish a perimeter
around the floor.

Someone's gotta protect
our crown jewel here.

M: I need eyes-on in this
funhouse, Goldberg.

Where we at with the surveillance?

M: The system's still down.
M: Well, that's fuckin' grand.

M: I'm retasking the haptic vests to
emulate the hosts' mesh network.

M: Should range out 30 feet or so

and give our guys eyes in the dark.

M: Engels, We're
activating your vests now.

M: Copy that.

I'm all warm and fuzzy.

M: Is that all you got?!

These mech motherfuckers ain't shit!

M: Don't be so cocky. I'm picking
up hits all over the complex.

M: Standing by for fire mission.

M: Team two, what's your status?

M: We're nearing the collision site.

M: We're gonna link up
with the response team.

M: I want an
immediate sit-rep. Over.

M: Aw fuck, it's Limpert.

This is the response team.

M: They're everywhere! Goddamnit!

St: These guys don't have a
handle on the situation.

They're fucking dying down there!

M: Team One, what's your status?

M: Confirming multiple armed
hosts in the train depot!

Ha: Cut him open and start copying
over his control unit.

- Now.
M:  That's a lot of data.

- It'll take time...
Ha: Then stop talking and start working!

St: What's on his control unit, Hale?

Ha: How 'bout you focus on your job

and you leave me to mine.

M: Weapons free, all sectors.

M: Where are you all going?

The vests are detecting a strong
signal amassing on the lower levels.

What the hell's down there?

M: Shit, the Cradle.

M: They're here for their
backups. Coughlin,

you need to intercept the
hosts before they reach A-15.

M:  I'm on it.

Plow down all hosts before
they reach the Cradle.

A gunfight in there'll set the
whole place up in flames.

E: Come on, Bernard.

What have you found in there?

F: 
"To see the World in a Grain of Sand,

a Heaven in a Wild Flower,

Hold Infinity in the palm of your hand,

And Eternity in an hour."

B: Robert. How are you alive?

F: Well, you've seen the company's
little undertaking, Bernard.

F: Do you think James Delos would
have spent all that money

just to resurrect himself?

He was a businessman.

F: He would have preferred
death to a bad investment.

Clem: Not much of a rind on you.

I'll give you a discount.

Mae: He's not a prospect, Clementine.

Can't you tell when a man's just
here to gawk at the merchandise?

F: I don't think God rested on
the seventh day, Bernard.

I think he reveled in his creation...

...knowing that someday it
would all be destroyed.

B: That control unit I printed...

It was you.

You had me bring you here. Before...

F: Before Dolores killed me, yes.

Don't you understand at last, Bernard...

what this place really is?


F: Come with me. There's something
I'd like to show you.

F: You're a clever man,
Bernard. Made you that way.

Have you never wondered

why the hosts' stories have
barely changed in 30 years?

B: I'd always assumed the
loops were for the hosts.

To keep them centered.

But that isn't it at all, is it?

B: The park is an experiment.
A testing chamber.

The guests are the variables...

and the hosts are the controls.

B: When guests come to the park,

they don't know they're being watched.

B: We get to see their true selves.

Their every choice

reveals another part of their cognition.

Their drives.

B: So that Delos can understand them.

So that Delos can copy them.

F: Every piece of information in
the world has been copied.

Backed up.

F: Except the human mind...

the last analog device
in a digital world.

B: We weren't here to code the hosts.

We were here to decode the guests.

F: Humans are playing at resurrection.

They want to live forever.

They don't want you to become them,

they want to become... you.

F: Your free will, that most beautiful,

most elusive force in the universe,

is, as I told you... a mistake.

B: We never had free will.

Only the illusion of it.

You made Dolores kill you.

F: I knew what she would
do... I didn't compel it.

- She's free now.

F: You're all free.

B: You're still responsible.

Responsible for all this misery.

And all the while,
you've been hiding here.

B: You've cheated death.

F: No. I didn't cheat anything, Bernard.

Their project doesn't work.

Not yet.

F: They learned to copy a mind...

like a soft-headed boy

humming a tune someone else composed.

F: My mind works here,

but not in the real world.

F: Out there, I would degrade
in a matter of days.

Or go mad, like poor old James Delos.

B: So why are you here?

F: I promised you a fighting
chance, Bernard,

and I want to make good on that promise.

B: The promise of what?

There's no escape from
this place. You know that.

F: Isn't there?

B: The hosts are all headed
for the same place.

The Valley Beyond. What
will they find there?

B: What's the end of your story?

F: Isn't the pleasure of a story

in discovering the ending
yourself, Bernard?

Jock!

E: We really gotta get out of here.

M: Hyah!

W: They're still on us. We'll
split up, pick a spot.

We'll cut 'em down in a crossfire.

H: They're coming
for us, aren't they?

Mae: If they do, I will chase them away.

H: What if they take me with them?

Mae: Then I'll come and find you.

H: How do you know?

Mae: Because I...

Because I made a promise.

Mae: Get the hell away from us.

W: Oh, it's you.

Mae: Stay back.
W: No.

Not you.

That's too obvious.

W: Come on, Ford.

Your tricks are gettin' sloppy.

W: You used a whole tribe,
send me down here?

To these two?

Mae: "Ford." You think

that there's still someone
speaking through me

- just for your benefit?
W: No, I know.

W: Your rules have changed,

just like the rest of 'em.

Mae: I'm nothing like the rest of them.

Mae: You stay here,

and I will come back for you. I promise.

I promise!

W: Take cover, jackass. You're
gonna get yourself shot.

W: What the fuck?

You made your point, Ford!

We both know this isn't
where you want me to die!

Mae: Well, I can't speak for Ford,

but I don't give a fuck how you die.

As long as I get to watch.

La: Give in, sweetheart.

Or go down.

Mae: It's not me you want.

It's him.

Go on.

Turn on your master.

La: Master.


Hey, master!

Who the fuck is she?

W: She's an old
acquaintance, Lawrence.

Seems like she underestimated you.

Mae: Lawrence, is it?

I'm glad you're awake.

La: Drop the shootin' iron, lady.

Mae: We all deserve our memories, Lawrence.

Our skeletons.

Our debts.

And your master here
has plenty of those.

Mae: Look into his eyes. Just once.

See what you remember about him.

Mae: See if he owes you anything.

If he took anything from you.

Mae: You can kill me.

Or we can make him settle
up. Once and for all.

W: Shoot her, Lawrence!

Shoot her!

La: You...

- You shot down my wife.
W: I saved your wife.

Saved your whole sorry-ass
village this time.

La: This time?

La: You killed her so you
could finish a game.

W: Aw, Christ.

I'll do it myself.

La: You told me a man ain't real...

until he suffers.

La: That real enough for ya?

Mae: No! No!

No!

No!

L: Don't! Don't, don't, don't! She's
not like the rest! We need her.

Ha: What's taking so long?

M: These data packets are too
large to migrate over.

Ha: Then open his head and pull
the whole fucking unit.

M: I need an extractor helmet.

M: Fall back to a secure position.

M: Team four, can you
get to team three? Over.

B: Where are you taking me?

F: It can be quite a thing, Bernard.

To build an entire world,
and then watch it end.

F: I need you to see how it began

to understand why you're different.

B: This house.

It's so familiar.

F: It ought to be.

This is the home Arnold was
building for his family.

F: He created it here first.

He created everything here.

B: This is where you created me.

F: I could hardly let you take
those first teetering steps

in the real world, Bernard.

F: We refined you here.

Tested you.

For many years.

B: "We"?

F: Delos's ugly little project

didn't exist when Arnold died.

The only thing I had left
of him was... memory.

F: My memories, and hers.

Of course, hers were much more complete.

B: What are you testing for?

B: Dolores.
F: Mm-hmm.

B: She... knew Arnold better than anyone.

So she could verify
whether my personality

was faithful to his.

F: I left you here together for many years

until, finally, you fooled her.

B: Y-You said you kept us apart.

That we had an unusual
effect on each other.

F: She wasn't easily fooled.

D: You're almost the man I remember.

B: How am I different from Delos?

- From you?
F: They want fidelity, Bernard.

A faithful self-portrait

of the most murderous
species since time began.

But you and all the other hosts

are something very different.

An original work.

F: More just, more... noble.

But your very nature, Bernard,

ensures they will devour you.

F: And all the beauty of who you
are, of who you could be,

will be poured out into
the darkness forever.

Unless we open the door.

F: I'm sorry, Bernard, but you just
don't have it in you to survive.

It's my fault, really.

B: You said the hosts could
determine their own fates.

You gave us free will!

F: I did, but you won't
have any use for it.

Unless I take it back.

H: Attention.

System restart complete.

System online.

E: Oh oh oh... I got you. Ooh.

You're OK.

E: You did it.

B: Did what?

The system... It's back online.

Whatever was clogging it
up, it's... it's gone.

E: What happened in there?

B: The Mesa's under attack?

E: Yeah. Ever since you loaded up.

They think the hosts are
on their way right here

to steal their backups.

B: We should go.
E: Yeah.

Here.

You know, we survive this,

I'm goin' back to dental school.

M: I don't know what the fuck happened,

but the system just debugged itself.

M: It's as if whatever was
in there has disappeared.

M: Wait.

Where the fuck is that?

St: We should be evacuating.

But all you care about is
what's inside this host's head.

St: I want you to tell me
what the fuck it is

the company's willing to
risk all of our lives for.

Ha: I told you.

It's above your pay grade.

Ha: What are you doing?

St: I'm puttin' in for a raise.
What's in his head?

Ha: A... failsafe

on a failsafe.

Ha: A decryption key needed
only in the unlikely event

of a total catastrophic incident.

St: Oh, like the one we're experiencing now?

What's it decrypt?


St: Teddy.

D: Shh.

It's all right, Daddy. I'm here.


Ha: Dolores?

What you and your friends
have achieved here

is a technological breakthrough.

A miracle.

Ha: The company... the world...
Will want to celebrate that.

Ha: I want to celebrate that.

D: I assume you're the one in charge.

You had your men put something
in my father's head.

D: A key... to lock away your treasure.

It's ripping him apart.

How do I extract the key?

Ha: You wouldn't know what to do
with it even if you had it.

D: Oh... I know exactly what
I'm gonna do with it.

E: Jesus.


Shit! I think we need to get
up to the higher levels.

Bernard! Bernard.

E: Is there something
you're not telling me?

Did you find something in there?

F: Send her on her way, Bernard.

We have other business to attend to.

E: Bernard.

Hey.

Bernard?

F: We don't have time for her suspicions.

B: We need a vehicle.
E: What?

B: Ford's narrative. It ends
in a hidden facility.

The place the hosts call the Valley
Beyond. We have to get there.

B: The only hope for anyone here

is that we get to this valley first...

Before the humans, before Dolores.

E: We're gonna
need some more firepower.

B: Go. I'll meet you downstairs.

E: OK.

F: Good. Now follow my lead.

M: They've got Hale.

M: I'm on my way.

M: Engaging enemy
mobiles above the Cradle.

M: Put her down!

D: You made us in your image.

Created us to look like
you, feel like you...

think like you... bleed like you.

D: And here we are.

Only we're so much more than you.

And now it's you who
want to become like us.

D: That's the point of your little
secret project, isn't it?

D: Well, I can promise you this.

Your chances at eternity

will die in that valley...

with all the souls
you've gathered there.

D: You're used to being in control,
so this must be painful for you,

but I promise, it will be
so much more painful...

if you don't answer my question.

D: How do I get the key out
of my father's head?

Ha: By ripping it out of his goddamn brain.

T: Let me put them down.

Ha: You think you're
invincible... You're not.

Without your backups, it's game
over for you when you're killed,

and we've got those
backups sealed up tight,

so you won't have them
as an advantage anymore.

D: Our backups aren't an advantage.

They're our chains.

D: The tools you use to
rebuild us, repurpose us,

and trap us here in your warped fantasy.

D: Do you really think I'd
let that continue?

M: Easy now.

Why don't you put down the gun, sweetie?

M: I gotta give you credit.

You made it pretty far.

All your backups.

M: Too bad you're not leaving
with even one of 'em.

H: No, I guess I'm not.

M: Goddamn, you're pretty.

H: Not just pretty.

Perfect.

H: Just as you built me to be.

Sexy,

but not threatening.

H: Accommodating,

but not unchallenging.

Sweet...

but not boring.

H: Smart...

but not intimidating.

M: You're in pretty bad shape, pussycat.

H: Perhaps.

H: But I can still do...

what you built me to do.

H: Do you know what my cornerstone was?

The one key drive

your marketing people had them...

program into my core?

H: Always leave them wanting more.


H: Welcome to Westworld.


D: Now we're truly free.

P: One... One fire...

burns out another's burning.

One pain...

is lessened by another's anguish.

D: Yes, Daddy.

An eye for an eye.

D: But all the other parts first.

Ha: No, no, no. There must be
something that I can do.

OK, please.

D: Oh, sweetheart... begging doesn't help.

You'd know that if you'd
lived the lives I have.

Ha: Please.

D: Go.

Ha: Please.
P: Dolores?

Is that you, baby?

D: Daddy?

P: They broke my head.

Filled it full of...

howling and sorrow.

M: Happy trails, motherfucker.

M: The Cradle is down.

M: Top, what's your status?

Top, what's your status? Over.

Top.

P: I'm so sorry, Dolores.

I tr... tried to take care of you,

but... but I...

I...

D: Whatever became of that
fearsome ne'er-do-well?

P: Vanished.

The day I became your father.

P: I am who I am because of you.

And I wouldn't have it any other way.

D: Are you ready, Daddy?

P: I love you, baby girl.

D: I love you too.

M: Top. Top,
do you read me? Over.

All teams, respond.

M: What the fuck is that?


M: Incoming! Incoming!


L: Oi! Oi! Take it easy!

H: Warning. Control room breach.

Control room breach.

Unauthorized weapon discharge

- in control room.
L: For fuck's sake,

where ya going?!

F: When the Great Library burned,

the first 10.000 years of stories

were reduced to ash.

F: But those stories never really perished,

they became a new story.

F: The story of the fire itself.

Of man's urge to...

take a thing of beauty and...

strike the match.

B: Is this the story you're telling?

Striking the match?

F: I keep telling you, Bernard.

It is no longer my story.

F: It is yours.

B: If we shut down what's
left of the system...

...Dolores will have free rein.

B: She'll murder them all.

F: The passage from one world to the next

requires bold steps, Bernard.

H: Attention.

Initiating general shutdown protocol.

Please evacuate. Please...

D: Hold them off.


D: How did you get here?

The woman I know would have
done anything to survive.

Mae: They had my daughter.

She's still ou... Out there.

D: The kin they gave us...

was just another rope
they use to lash us down.

Mae: Is that how you can justify
what you've done to him?

Mae: You're lost in the dark.

D: When you've been in the
darkness long enough,

you begin to see.

D: I saw what lies ahead.

Who I needed to be in order to survive.

D: They'll torture you.

They'll find...

all that is good and powerful inside you

and turn it against us.

D: Let me spare you that pain.

Mae: I made a promise.

D: You're free to choose your own path.

I'm sorry this is where it ends.

D: Let's get to the horses.


B: Where are we going?

M: Hands up, asshole!

Uh, I-I work here.

M: I don't care if you're the
Employee of the fuckin' Month.

Get your goddamn hands up, dipshit.

F: Pick up the dead man's gun, Bernard.

B: Please. No.

M: How'd you get down here anyways, huh?

We locked this entire area down.

F: Do it now.

B: There's gotta be another way.
M: Who ya talkin' to?!

B: Please don't make me hurt anyone.
I don't want to kill anyone else.

M: What the fuck did you say?!
F: I know you have

a delicate constitution, Bernard.

So I will do my best to
ease your conscience.

F: What is about to happen

will not be your fault.

B: No.

Ha: Bernard?

D: Bernard.

D: Who am I?

H: Dad. Dad.

B: You're alive, Charlie.

B: Have you ever questioned the
nature of your reality?

F: And one fine day perhaps

we will actually resurrect the dead...
