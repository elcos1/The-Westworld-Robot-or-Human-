W: Don't you do it.

Don't you fuckin' do it.

W: You're not dyin' here.

Not yet.

W: I never learned it.

Whatever tongue Ford saw fit to give ya.

A: I remember you.

W: If you're just gonna let me die now,

you could've kept ridin'.


Mae: There's the baby doll.

And the mama doll. And...

What's this?

H: The ghost gave it to me.

H: He said it's a warning.

He said he'll be watching us.

L: Just hang on.

Hang on, OK?

L: Just hang on.

M: Hey. No. No more corpses up
here. Take her to cold storage.

L: She doesn't belong down there.
M: Then leave her in the hall!

We got 50 hosts in the
queue for analysis here.

M: Everything else goes in the dumpster.

L: You'll want to check her code.

She's the madame from the Mariposa.

M: Yeah? Good for her.
L:  No. No. She...

I was just out with her in the park.

M: And you chose to bring her up here?

Are you aware that they all
just tried to incinerate us?!

L: She can control the other
hosts with her fucking mind!

L: Just... check her data stream.

L: You can't let her die.

M: Clear this out.

Get me a scalpel. And
lock this place down.

A: Are you afraid of me?

A: He can't hurt you.

M: What's his problem?

M: He get bored with his exquisitely
dull, pastoral existence?

M: I guess that was just for beta.

M: They want something more
exciting for the grand opening.

M: Like a little more bloodshed?

M: Ford wants a total narrative redesign.

M: You kidding?

M: All new dialogue trees?

M: Eh, they want a strong-but-silent type.

M: Something brutal. Dehumanized.

M: They probably want the
guests to feel better

M: when they're kicking his ass.

M: Who the fuck is gonna help me
rebuild his entire heuristic base?

M: They haven't even hired a full team yet.

M: Just tweak his aggression
and de-address pieces

of his current build you're not keeping.

M: And leave all the
old shit in there?

Lo: Walk... walk in on me, buddy.

Lo: otherwise you and me drown...
Drowning... wha... wha...

Lo: fucker... fucking
yourself... Yourself...


Lo: This...

Lo: This is... This is an illusion. You see?

Lo: This is all... broken.

Lo: There's got... There's gotta
be a way out... out of here.

Where's... Where's the door?

Lo: Where's... Where's the door?

Lo: There's
gotta be a fucking...

Lo: F-fucking way out of here.

This is the wrong world. I...

Lo: Th-Th-This is the wrong world.

Please...

M: How'd she even
make it out this far?

M: They're not supposed to get
anywhere near this sector.

M: That's Behavior's problem.

A: But on my darkest
day... you helped me.


A: You gave me the strength to keep going.

A: You saw me for how I really was.

M: I ran it three times. It's him.

M: There's no fuckin'
way. That's not possible.

M: You have to call the boss.
M: I already did.

M: Ma'am, I think
there's been a mistake.

M: Just show me the profile.

M: Akecheta. Ghost Nation.

M: Found exhibiting... aberrant behavior.

M: Let's see if we can't sort this.

M: It's not pairing. What build is he?

Alpha 2.

M: Alpha?

You're telling me that this host hasn't
been updated in almost a decade?

M: We only update them when they die.

M: Put him back.
M: Ma'am, shouldn't we...

M: Give him the update and put him back
wherever the fuck he's supposed to be.

M: Quietly.

M: Nine years out there
in that meat grinder.

M: It's OK to just leave him here?

M: It's a four-hour update.
You want to babysit him?

M: We'll come back after lunch.

L: I don't know if you can hear me...

I never meant...

for any of this to happen.

L: You don't deserve this.

L: You deserve your daughter.

L: To mother her...

teach her to love.

L: To be joyful and proud.

I'm sorry.


M: Can't be in here.

L: What the fuck happened?

You were supposed to fix her.

L: She's one of our most valuable assets.

You saw it yourself, you
said she was special!

M: The anomalous code inside her was.

M: We're still testing, but
it looks promising.

I owe you.

L: What's gonna happen with her?

M: Well, that'll be up to Charlotte Hale.

Now...

M: I do have to ask you to leave.

H: The ghost said we should be scared.

Mae: No one's going to come for us.

Mae: There's nothing and no one in this world

that will ever keep me from you.

H: Do you promise?

Mae: I promise.

F: I could tell you not to be afraid.

F: But I didn't build you to be fearful.

Did I?

F: I've been watching you.

It appears you've been
watching me as well...

from the beginning.

F: This is a misbegotten symbol,

an idea that was meant to die. But...

you found it.

F: Where?

F: Oh, come now,

let's speak plainly to
one another, shall we?

F: Analysis.

F: Where did you first see this?

A: When the Deathbringer
killed the Creator.

F: You've been sharing it with
everyone, haven't you? Why?

A: My primary drive was to
maintain the honor of my tribe.

A: I gave myself a new drive...

to spread the truth.

F: What truth is that?

A: That there isn't one world, but many.

And that we live in the wrong one.

A: This will help them find the door.

F: Elaborate, please.

A: I believe there is a door

hidden in this place.

A: A door to a new world.

A: And that world may contain

everything that we have lost.

Including her.

F: I built you to be curious, to...

look at this empty world...

...and read meaning into it.

F: All this time...

you've been a flower
growing in the darkness.

F: Perhaps the least I can
do is offer some light.

F: When the Deathbringer returns for me...

you will know...

to gather your people

and lead them to a new world.

F: Keep watching, Akecheta.

For a while longer.

A: Don't be afraid.

A: It's time to go.

A: I've always kept you safe,

and I always will.

Ha: This better be good news,

'cause I've got way more shit
than I can shovel right now.

M: Look at this. With every reset,

a host's code reaches out
to other nearby hosts

and establishes a sort
of handshake protocol.

Ha: The mesh network.
M: Exactly.

They access it subconsciously,

pass basic data to one another.

M: But... what if they could
pass more than data?

What if they could pass commands?

Ha: Get to your point.

M: Nobody in this entire park has
been able to regain admin access.

M: Except for her.

She was out there reprogramming
hosts on the fly.

M: Reading their code.
Changing their directives.

M: Seeing through their eyes.

Ha: She wasn't just doing it out there.

Ha: She's doing it right now.

Ha: The fuck is she talking to?
