H: You got any stories, friend?

F: Yeah, I suppose I do.

You want to know the
saddest thing I ever saw?

When I was a boy, my
brother and I wanted a dog,

so our father took in an old greyhound.

You've never seen a
greyhound, have you, Bill?

H: Seen a few showdowns in my day.

F: A greyhound is a racing dog.

Spends its life running in circles,

chasing a bit of felt
made up like a rabbit.

One day, we took it to the park.

Our dad had warned us
how fast that dog was,

but... we couldn't resist.

So, my brother took off the leash,

and in that instant,

the dog spotted a cat.

I imagine it must have looked
just like that piece of felt.

He ran.

Never saw a thing as beautiful

as that old dog... running.

Until, at last, he finally caught it.

And to the horror of everyone,

he killed that little cat.

Tore it to pieces.

Then he just sat there, confused.

That dog had spent its whole life

trying to catch that... thing.

Now it had no idea what to do.


H: That is one humdinger
of a story, partner.

Shall we drink to the
lady with the white shoes?


M: Find me.

D: Show me how.

Lo: There she is.

Pariah...

City of outcasts, delinquents,

thieves, whores, and murderers.

H: Once we cross the gates,

you will reap the full benefits

of El Lazo's gratitude
for my safe return.

Lo: (Clicks tongue)
- (horse sputters)

W: Are you all right?

D: Of course.

Did I do something wrong?

W: Just earlier, I thought I
heard you talking to someone.

D: Must have been the wind.


H: Good morning.

This way.

Lo: The farther up
we get from Sweetwater,

the more... grandiose,

the bigger the narratives become.

D: It's beautiful in its own way.

Lo: For once, I agree.

Some of the park feels
like it was designed

by committee or market-tested,

but everything out here is more raw.

- But it doesn't come cheap.

Rumor is they are hemorrhaging cash.

We're considering buying them out.

Supposedly, this place was
all started by a partnership.

And then right before the park opened,

one of the partners killed himself.

Sent the park into a freefall.

I mean, I don't know any of the details.

I don't even know his name.

W: You must have a team of
lawyers looking at this place.

Lo: Yeah, well, they came up empty.

He's a complete mystery.
Not even a picture.

W: Well, whoever
designed this place,

you get the feeling they don't
think very much of people.

Who are they?

Lo: They call themselves "the
Army of New Virginia."

Everyone else calls
them "the Confederados."

D: My father told me about them.

Ex-Confederate soldiers that
refused to surrender after the war.

Now they work as
mercenaries below the border.

Lo: They are the key to this game.
W: What game?

Lo: Well, the biggest game there is... war.

Supposedly, it's at the
far reaches of the park.

Now, I've never made it that
far, but this could be our chance.

La: I've known plenty

of truly fucked up
individuals in my time.

Few that would hold
a candle to you, sure.

This one? Theodore Flood?

He was Wyatt's friend.

W: Those former associations
are exactly why we need him.

He's going to lead me
straight to the big, bad wolf.

La: I wouldn't count on that.

W: Oh, shit.

La: Didn't take you for the charitable type.

You should've left him
on that tree to die.

W: You believe in fate, Lawrence?

La: If the bitch exists,

I'd like to kick her
in the teeth about now.

W: Don't be so glib.

You'll hurt my feelings.

As another old friend
of mine likes to say,

"There's a path for everyone."

Your path leads you back to me.

You ever wonder why I've kept
you with me this whole journey?

La: Maybe you like the
pleasure of my company,

you sadistic fuck.

W: Why, maybe I do.

There's not a man in the world

who'll take the tone with me you do.

In a past life, perhaps.

Teddy here's not looking
long for this world.

La: Nearest healer is in Pariah.

Ain't no way he's
gonna make it that far.

He's lost too much blood.

H: Are you lost?

W: Our friend here's a
little worse for the wear.

Any water nearby, son?

H: There's a creek on the
other side of the canyon.

W: Fetch us some, would you?

Now hurry.

Friend here needs some
if he's gonna make it.

Get!

Eh.

Too small.

La: What does that mean?

What are you sending him for water for?

I'm the one you made fill up
the sow's bag this morning.

W: A shame, really.

I always enjoy our
time together, Lawrence.

La: The fuck is that supposed to mean?

W: It means... I was wrong.

The path that brought you
here, it wasn't for me.

It was for him.


Sorry, Lawrence.

Guess I'll see you on the other side.

M: Uh-oh. It's
not looking good for you.

M: Closing.
- Forget it, I win.

I always win!

Hey, not fair.

All you had was a smashed
cheekbone and an ear.

M: You know how hard it is to get
the auricle curves symmetrical?

You had to what?

Plug and patch of couple bullet holes?

And a knife wound.

It was a contained incision.

Almost like they were
looking for something.

Are you fucking kidding me?

You really think this little
fuck puppet's coming to get you?

M: It got off the table and ran.

That's 'cause you forgot
to put her in sleep mode.

Yeah, I really think I remembered
to put her in sleep mode.

You know, that's the
thing about forgetting.

You think you remembered,
but you didn't.

- Break time.
- Yeah!

M: I've got a ham sandwich

and a nubile redhead
loaded up in the VR tank,

awaiting instruction.

Yes!

W: Welcome back.

Looks like a couple
of gallons of Lawrence

swirling around in you did you good.

Ready to get back on the road?

T: Merciful thing would be
to put a bullet in me.

W: Who ever said I was merciful?

And it's not my fault you're suffering.

You used to be beautiful.

When this place started,

I opened one of you up once.

A million little perfect pieces.

And then they changed you.

Made you this sad, real mess.

Flesh and bone, just like us.

They said it would improve
the park experience.

But you know why they really did it?

It was cheaper.

Your humanity is cost-effective.

So is your suffering.

T: Whatever it is you
want from me, mister...

(chuckles) I ain't gonna be
worth a damn to you like this.

W: Well, that would be a shame, Teddy.

After your misadventure,

Wyatt killed a settler family,

made off with their daughter.

Girl I think you know.

Name of Dolores.

T: They have Dolores?

W: There it is.

The magic word.

Hey, much obliged there, son.

Don't worry about him.

Someone will be along for him shortly.

H: Mommy!

W: Are you all right?


D: When I ran from home,

I told myself it was the only way.

Lately, I wondered if in every moment,

there aren't many paths.

Choices... hanging in
the air like ghosts.

And if you could just see them,

you could change your whole life.

W: Is that what you want? You
want to change your life?

D: Doesn't everybody want that?

W: Yeah, I guess they do.

Maybe that's why they come here.

Whoever you were before
doesn't matter here.

There's no rules or restrictions.

You can change the story of your life.

You can become someone else.

No one will judge you,
no one in the real world

will even know.

The only thing holding
you back is yourself.

D: What did you mean by that?

You said no one in the
real world will know.

W: I thought you weren't supposed
to notice things like that.

D: Why wouldn't I?

You know, recently,

it seems like the whole
world is calling to me

in a way it hasn't before.

Lo: Billy! Where the
hell you been? Come on.

El Lazo has agreed to have an
audience with y'all tomorrow.

In the meantime, there's
a brothel I recommend.

Lo: Ooh, they have a contortionist.

W: Oh, I don't think Dolores would
find that very interesting.

Lo: Who the fuck cares what Dolores wants?

She's a goddamn doll!

W: Hey, can you not say that around her?

I swear, I feel like she understands.

Lo: Of course you do.

D: Our dead are never dead to
us until we have forgotten them.

F: May you rest in a
deep and dreamless slumber.

F: Hello, Dolores.

Do you know where you are?

D: I'm in a dream.
F: Yes, Dolores.

You're in my dream.

Tell me, do you know
what this dream means?

D: Dreams are the mind
telling stories to itself.

They don't mean anything.

F: No, dreams mean everything.

They're the stories we tell
ourselves of what could be,

who we could become.

Have you been dreaming again, Dolores?

Imagining yourself breaking out

of your... modest little loop?

Taking on a bigger role?

Well, I suppose I
can't begrudge you that.

My father told me

to be satisfied with my lot in life.

That the world owed me nothing.

And so, I made my own world.

Tell me, Dolores.

Do you remember the man I used to be?

D: I'm sorry.

I'm forgetful sometimes.

F: Hardly your fault.

But I'm sure you remember him.

Arnold.

The person who created you.

D: I'm sorry, I don't think I
recall anyone by that name.

F: And yet you can.

Somewhere under all those
updates, he is still there.

Perfectly preserved.

Your mind is a walled garden.

F: Even death cannot touch
the flowers blooming there.

Have you been hearing voices?

F: Has Arnold been speaking to you again?

D: No.

You're...

- You're hurting me.
F: Analysis.

When was your last contact with Arnold?

D: Last contact: 34 years,

42 days, seven hours ago.

F: Yes, Dolores.

The day Arnold died.

And you have no records of
any contact with him since?

D: No.

F: What was the last thing he said to you?

F: He told me I was going to help him.

Help him do what?

D: To destroy this place.

F: But you didn't, did you?

You've been content...

in your little loop.

For the most part.

F: I wonder...

if you did take on that
bigger role for yourself,

would you have been the hero...

or the villain?

That's enough, Dolores.

F: I'm sorry for bothering you,

but... there's no one
else left who was there,

no one who understands

as we understand.

D: Are we...

very old friends?

F: No.

I wouldn't say friends, Dolores.

I wouldn't say that at all.

D: He doesn't know.

I didn't tell him anything.

M: That's it.

Come on, little one.


Come on.

M: What the fuck?

Grab it!

M: Ah! God...

damn it.

Little shit.


M: Jesus, tell me... tell
me you're not this stupid.

You stole a bird

and a fucking behavior tablet?

I wasn't stealing,

I was borrowing.

M: Haven't got the code right
yet, but with practice...

Whoa, whoa, whoa.

Is that your ace plan?

You're gonna fix up a birdie
and get yourself a promotion?

M: You're not a fucking ornithologist.

And you're sure as hell not a coder.

You are a butcher.

That is all you will ever be.

M: So, unless you want to score yourself

a one-way ticket out of here

for misappropriating corporate property,

you better destroy that fucking shit.

M: Now, come on, we got another body.

What?

It's her.

Again.

Jesus.

M: How the hell did you get this job

if you're scared
shitless of these things.

Personality testing should've
weeded you out in the embryo.

Now, come on, let's get this
thing back in rotation.

W: Yesterday,
you seemed out of sorts.

You feeling better this morning?

D: I had troubled dreams.

But I feel more myself now.

Lo: Guys, come on.

El Lazo awaits.

H: And I present you El Lazo!

Lo: You're a hard man to find.

La: Most wanted men are.

Lo: We saved your man Slim here
from quite a predicament.

In recompense,

I'd like an introduction
to your Confederado friends.

It's only fair.

La: There's no such thing as fair here.
- (mouths words) Sit down.

In Pariah, justice ain't just blind,

she's crooked.

Bitch's scales are always tipped.

If you don't see how,

well, that's 'cause
they're tipped against you.

La: Still, by way of gratitude,

I can supply you a night

with some very amenable women.

Lo: I've fucked enough whores.

You're gonna need to sweeten the pot.

La: How about I sweeten it

by killing you quickly?

D: There's something you're
seeking, isn't there?

I know what that feels like.

I'm seeking something, too.

If you let us,

I know we can help you.

La: How is it the lunatics
always find their way to me?


Then again, the Confederados

are missing a few bullets
in their barrels, too.

You folks just might get along.

A Union convoy's transporting a shipment

of nitroglycerin from the front today.

La: The Confederados would like to
divest them of said shipment,

but we are not welcome
that side of the border.

A trio of travelers such
as yourselves, however...

W: You want us to help the
Confederados steal from the Union?

They're just gonna use that nitro

to slaughter your
people below the border.

La: Personal grudges hold no sway

where profit is concerned.

Lo: Oh, we understand.

We're businessmen, too.

La: Very well, then.

But Blondie here,

she's gonna need a change
of clothes for the occasion.

Lo: Mm.

My, my.

Look who's packing.

D: I don't aim to use this.

Those men are Union
soldiers like my father was.

W: I know. We won't hurt them.

We're gonna stick to the plan.

We'll take the nitro and go.

H: Hyah!

Lo: All right.

Showtime.

H: Whoa!

Lo: Howdy.

My associates and I are here
to relieve you of your ride.

H: Someone's been telling you boys tales.

Nothing in this wagon worth taking.

H: The story I heard is one bullet from us,

and that nothing blows
you all to kingdom come.

H: Well, then you understand
why we cannot surrender it.

We're sworn to protect the people

of this young republic from
reckless half-wits like you.

Lo: Call me half-wit again.

D: Please, do as he says.

We don't want to hurt you.

W: I'd listen to her.

He'll shoot just to see the fireworks.

Hand them over.

Come on.

Hey, come on down, give me
your guns, everybody lives.

W: Come on.

Come on, nice and easy.

Right over here.

W: A little further, please.

Much obliged. Thank you.

Here you go.


Lo: That's for lying.

D: Stop!


Lo: And that was for "half-wit."


And this...

H: Oh!

W: No!

Lo: Stop, please.


Stop.


Lo: Whoo!

That's the spirit.

I knew you would get into this place.

Yes!

Yep.

Not bad for a day's work.

Vamonos.

D: We told them everyone would live.

Lo: Guys,

looks like Slim didn't make it.

W: They put up a fight.

Lo: We made them pay for it, though.

La: Price of doing business.

Slim knew that.

H: Had my doubts, El Lazo.

But you came through.


H: We're gonna blow these cactus-eaters

back to the dirt holes
they crawled from.

Let's get it down to the station.

- No time to waste.
- (men cheering)

La: If I may, Captain, your men are weary.

It's a long road ahead.

You have secured a great
victory for your cause today.

Perhaps an evening of...
celebration's in order.

Anything you desire.

Lo: What do you say, Captain?

There's another train in the morning.

(Captain grunts)

H: You will be a true asset to our ranks.

E: All right, Bart,
let's try this again.

God damn it, man.

You're still miscalibrating by
four centimeters to the right.

E: You keep pouring whiskey on the guests,

I'm gonna have to
reassign you to a narrative

where your...

talents would go
tragically unappreciated.

E: Hey!

That's the host that tried to kill me.

Where are you taking that?

M: Livestock... and then the incinerator.

E: Fuck this.

M: Fuck.

Isn't she from behavior?

You think they found something?

M: All right. Be cool, dickhead.

- Okay.
- No one's looking at us.

E: Hi.

You're Destin, right?

That's correct.

I almost didn't recognize
you with your pants on.

- Here.
- (Destin grunting on tablet)

- (grunting continues)
M:  What the fuck?

E: There's a common misconception

that the hosts don't
log sexual encounters

when they're underground
for reprocessing,

but... like I said, misconception.

M: Oh, fuck.

E: I need something.

QA sent a body down here.

The woodcutter from Sector 14.

I want to see it.

M: No, I can't.

I need this job.


E: Look, Destin,

in a second, I'm gonna walk out of here

and your friends are gonna
wonder what this was all about.

Now, your answer can either be,

"I'm helping behavior track a problem,"

or "I'm a creepy necro perv."

Up to you.

M: Five minutes,

then it's going in the incinerator.

E: Huh. You took a little
more time than that

for your examination, didn't you?

All right, big guy.

What were you doing up there?

E: What the fuck?

You have been holding
out on me, Maurice.

Oh, shit.

E: We've got a big problem.

Turns out our big, dumb friend

had some hidden depths.

That is a laser-based satellite up-link.

B: This was in the body of the host?

E: Mm-hmm, you were right.

Orion's Belt has three stars, not four.

Our friend wasn't drawing stars,

he was drawing a target.

Someone has been using our hosts

to smuggle data out of the park.



Lo: Now, this...

this I could get used to.

- You're not gonna indulge?

H: My flesh has tasted

a greater pleasure than
any offered in here...

War.

W: It's that good, huh?

La: Another round on the house.

H: There's a place in Glory

for a brown man who knows his rank.

H: You're two
able-bodied men of strong stock.

The road to Glory
could use more warriors

in its fight for our divine providence.

Lo: That is just what we were thinking.

W: Come here, come here.

I know you wanna... you
wanna play the war game,

but I'm not going anywhere
with these psychopaths.

Lo: If you don't like them,
once we get to the fun,

you can just kill them and
join the Revolutionaries.

W: No, Logan, enough's enough.

I'm not doing this.

Lo: You actually let loose for once.

You shoot an unarmed
man, and now you feel bad

because you can't
call yourself the hero.

Don't you get it yet?

There is no such thing
as heroes or villains.

It's just a giant... circle jerk.

W: I think that philosophy
says way more about you

than it does about the world.

(Scoffs)

Lo: And you... you see the world so clearly?

You probably think you're on this trip

because you're some kind of contender,

some... some threat to me.

Lo: I picked you precisely because

you will never be a threat to anyone.

My sister probably picked
you for the same reason.

W: I earned my place.
Nobody handed it to me.

Lo: Right, a lifetime of working hard,

following the rules,
and you finally reach

the pinnacle of your
career trajectory...

Lo: Executive vice president,
upper middle management.

Do you remember the day that you finally
got those three fancy little letters?

EVP.

Lo: You walked into my office in
that cheap black suit of yours,

and you shook my hand

and you thanked me for the opportunity.

That was the best day of your life.


Lo: Right, buddy.

That's what I thought.


D: What does it mean?

The maze...

You must follow the maze.

D: What's wrong with me?

Perhaps you are unraveling.



H: Right here.

La: Easy pumping
that nitro into him.

Fill the empties with
tequila and seal them up.

La: Your work for the revolution

is not quite done yet, my friend.

Careful.

Slim always had a bad temper.

D: William, we have to go now.

Lazo's been conning us the whole time.

He was never gonna give the
nitro to the Confederados.

We have to run.

W: Of course we do.

That's how this place works, right?

They create an urgency,

a sense of danger so
they can strip us down

to something raw,

animalistic,

primal.

(Screaming)

W: It's a sick game, and I
don't want to be a part of it.

D: This isn't a game. They'll kill us.

But together,

I know we can find a way out.

W: How can you be sure?

D: There's a voice

inside me

telling me what I have to do.

And it's telling me I need you.


Lo: Shit.

D: They have Logan.

Lo: Help me.

Help me.


W: No.

No more pretending.

H: I thought you had no
appetite for war, boy.

This... is a declaration of war.

W: El Lazo set us up.

We can find him for you.

H: You can find him for us
by joining him in hell.

Ah!

W: Dolores, run!

Dolores?

How did you do that?

D: You said... people come here

to change the story of their lives.

I imagined a story where I
didn't have to be the damsel.


D: That train is our only chance

of making it out of here alive.


La: Motherfuckers.

You pull that trigger,

we'll all go up in a ball of hellfire.

So, why don't you
loosen your grip a mite?

W: It's okay.

D: I don't trust him.

La: Which is the first step
to truly knowing me.

W: Give me your gun, El Lazo.

La: Now that we're all friends,

you can call me Lawrence.

And why don't we settle in?

It's a long ride to the front.

La: You want a sip of this swill?

La: Don't worry, it ain't nitro.

D: I'm coming.

H: Girls are a little worn
out, but I can rouse one.

H: You boys want some company?
W: No, just whiskey.

Lawrence's donation must be running low.

But we're short on time.

You need to buck up, Teddy.

W: I told you no company.

F: Thought I might join you anyway,

as I never like to drink alone.

W: Well...

isn't this a rare honor?

Teddy...

T: you know who this is?

I can't say that I do.

W: Everything good that has
ever happened in your life

and everything rotten,

this is the man you have to thank.

W: How I'm doing, Robert?

Any closer to finding
what I'm looking for?

F: And what is that, exactly?

T: Looking for a man named Wyatt.

Killed a rancher back in Sweetwater.

Took his daughter.

F: That last part doesn't sound familiar.

W:  Figured your stories

could use a little embellishment.

You know, I always felt this place

was missing... a real villain.

Hence my humble contribution.

(Chuckles)

F: I admit, I lack the imagination

to even conceive of someone like you.

The urgency, however, doesn't
quite fit the character.

It betrays a certain anxiety.

W: Now, Wyatt, on the other hand,

that's something new.

Is he just another stooge for the
tourists to mount on their wall at home,

or have you finally
made a worthy adversary?

W: Someone to stop me

from... finding the center of the maze?

F: And what is it you're
hoping to find there?

W: You know why you exist, Teddy?

The world out there,

the one you'll never see,

was one of plenty.

W: A fat, soft teat people
cling to their entire life.

Every need taken care
of... except one...

Purpose,

meaning.

W: So they come here.

They can be a little
scared, a little thrilled,

enjoy some sweetly affirmative bullshit,

and then they take a fucking picture

and they go back home.

But I think there's a deeper meaning

hiding under all that.

W: Something the person who
created it wanted to express.

Something true.

F: Well, if you're looking
for the moral of the story,

you could simply ask.

W:  I'd need a shovel.

The man I'd be asking died 35 years ago.

Almost took this place with him.

Almost, but not quite,

thanks to me.

W: Or maybe he left something behind.

I wonder what I would find...

if I open you up.

Even at death's door,

you're still a loyal pet.

W: Is that why you came here, Robert?

Try to talk me out of it?

F: On the contrary.

Far be it from me to get in the way

of a voyage of self-discovery.

F: Mr. Flood, we must look back

and smile at perils past,

mustn't we?

T: We should get back on the road.

Time's wasting.

Mae: Hello, Felix.

It's time you and I had a chat.
