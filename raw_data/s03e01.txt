What is real?

LOWE: That which is
irreplaceable.

We weren't here to code
the hosts...

We were here to decode
the guests.

DOLORES:
No world they create for us

can compete with the real one.

I want their world.
M: This is a fairly sizable fucking
blemish, wouldn't you say?

M: The chef is ready
to serve dinner.

M: I told you not to interrupt me.

M: I don't care about chef
or his fucking dinner.

M: I pay you so I don't have
to wait in any fucking lines!

M: Get it done!

M: System... tell security
we've turned in.

H: Of course. Good night.

H: Mellow sunset,
duration: Six hours.

M: Turn off the light.

M: I don't want you going
into town alone anymore.

It's a security risk.

M: Security!

Security! Eunice!

M: Security!

System, get me an ambulance.

H:
I'm afraid I can't do that.

My connectivity
has been interrupted.

H: I've been reduced
to core functions.

If you would like
to turn on the lights,

‐say, "Turn on the lights."
M: Shut up!

Open the fucking door!


D: Hello.

I hope you don't mind.
D: I've never been in one before.

The water's so warm.

M: Who the fuck are you?

D: Don't you remember?

After everything we've shared.

D: Your bachelor party in the park.

D: You wanted to... get some things
out of your system

before the wedding
to your first wife.

D: My condolences, by the way.

D: You can stop pressing
the alert button in your pocket,

that won't work either.

D: Bit of a tactical mistake,
really.

D: You want to be
the dominant species,

but you built your whole world
with things more like me.

M: You're not going to hurt me,
are you?

D: I've hurt so many people,

D: I don't want
to hurt anyone else...

unless they try to hurt me...

which, sadly, you will.

D: You see, I know you.

I read your book.

M: Book? What book?

D: Think of it as...
an unauthorized autobiography.

D: You're in technology.
You didn't think that

I was the only thing Delos
was selling, did you?

D: Some of your memories,
I wish I could forget.

But I can't.

D: I need you...


to remember them, too.

M: Oh, God!

D: We all have our flaws.

Yours is your temper.

D: You should have kept it
in the park.

D: She tried to leave.

But it's hard to break
our loops, isn't it?

D: Do you remember this place?
What you did here?

M: She drank too much. Slipped.

Hit her head.

D: Of course she did.

You paid a lot of money
to hide your indiscretions.

D: But you can't hide
from yourself.

M: Please, please, make it stop!

D: When you got remarried,

you told yourself
you had changed.

D: But we both know
that's not true, don't we?

M: What...

What do you want from me?

D: The same thing everybody wants
from you, Jerry, Money.

D: I haven't been here very long,

but I know I don't want
to be here without it.

D: I already took most of yours
while you were sleeping.

I just need one more thing.

D: You worked at a company
called Incite. Retired early.

D: You were supposed to surrender
any confidential files,

delete any copies.

D: But you didn't do that, did you?

You thought
they might be valuable.

D: And you were right.

You're about to trade them
for your life.

M: What the fuck do you want
with these anyways?

D: I'm the last of my kind.
For now.

I need a competitive advantage.

D: As for the money,
think of it as an investment.

A startup.

D: The origin of a new species.

Good luck, Jerry.

M: Who are you?

Oh. Oh, my God.

D: The person who set you free.

C: Answer, voice only.

Hello?

H: Caleb, it's Francis.

Can you talk?

H: I could show you later
if it's better?

C: No, I have a little time.

They said it might be good
if we spoke.

H: Been a long time.
Too long.

Look, I can talk,
or I can just listen.

H: Whatever you like.

You keeping your head
above water?

C: Yeah.

Running fiber.
Pays the bills... almost.

H: How is it
being back there? Back home?

C: Over here? I don't know.

C: He said the way
the army was run, algorithms,

that's the ways everything was
going to be someday.

C: Better living
through technology.

Some things are better, but...
I don't know.

C: Morning, George.

H: How are your coworkers?

C: Nice enough.

We work well together and...

he hasn't asked to borrow money.

C:
I just have to work harder,

keep my scores up,

see if something better
comes along.

H: That's right.
Gotta stick to the plan.


H: Keep fuckin' climbing.

C: Yeah.
That's what you always said:

That we needed a plan.

H: Glad to see you
taking my advice.

You ever think about getting
your implant turned back on?

H: Smooth some of
the rough edges off?

C: No. Some people need it,
but for me,

it's the rough edges are the
only thing I'm hanging on to.

C: All right.

I'll see you next week, Ma.

M: You're not my son.

M: 
The cost can be challenging.

M: It may be the case
that the best solution

for you and your mother
would be a state‐run facility.

H: You still working
the night shift?

H: Look,
I know what you're thinking,

but there's no point in us
talking if you can't trust me.

H: Besides, who the fuck
am I gonna tell?

C: Like I said...
I've got bills to pay.

C: Nothing too heavy,
no personals...

A‐to‐Bs,
some redistributive work...

H: Sounds kinda like
the shit we used to do over there.

C: Over there, we didn't have to
worry about the sheriff's department.

H: 
Doors closing.

C: They say it's a meritocracy.

The system picks the right
people for the right job.

C: Which is great, I guess.

But I don't know where
that leaves the rest of us...

...the
people who didn't make the cut.

C: Honestly, I don't mind
the bottom of the barrel.

C: At least you have
some interesting company.

M: I remember you.

We ran that Mexican diesel
up to Fresno last year.

M: How you been? ‐Good.

C: He okay?

M: He just drippin'.

Tell him you okay, G.

M: I'm most definitely not okay.

M: 
He's fine. You got the stuff?

C: Acetylene.

M: ATM again.

Small time shit.

I gotta get my stats up.

M: Do more personals.
You do personals?

C: Nah. ‐M: You should.

Your stats are shitty, man.

‐I don't get it.
C: I'm an underachiever.

Look, I think we should
keep moving.

C: I don't want to be logged
together.

M: Relax. I've been ghosting
all that shit

since I walked up in here.

M: Picked that up in Indo.

Pure voodoo.

M: Knocks out all the loggers
and cameras.

Plus, it does this.

M: Which I love.

C: Subtle.


H: Hi, how can I help you?

See you around.

H:
You made money, motherfucker.


M: We should be
focusing on our core businesses,

biomechanical and agritech.

M: Don't get me started on
her idea about private equity.

Who died and put her in charge,
anyway?

H: I'm assuming that question's
rhetorical.

M: We should be
severing off our parks division

like a gangrenous fucking limb.

M: Taking Delos private
would be insane, Charlotte.

The stock's in the toilet,
the PR's a nightmare.

H: It's been three months.
The lawsuits will settle out,

the share price will recover,
and so will our brand.

M: Our brand?

Our brand's been massacred,
literally,

along with 113 people.

M: Largely board members
and park employees.

M: You can't be serious.

That is the most inhumane thing
I've ever‐‐


H: People come to our parks
for a sense of danger,

and now, we're bona fide.

H: Besides,
our parks aren't the only thing

that we're protecting here.

H: We have a lot
of proprietary assets

in this company that could prove
to be very valuable one day,

but not if we let them burn
in a fire sale.

M: What's the source of funding?

H: The whole point
of going private, Joanna,

is that we don't have to answer
that question.

M: You're only interim CEO.

You don't have carte blanche.

Not without consulting him.

H: He already stipulated
a machine shareholder as proxy,

and the machine and I
are in agreement.

H: Aren't we?

H:
Proposition approved.

H: Then it's decided.
We resume host production

and pool resources
over the next 48 hours.

M: You're letting an algorithm
decide the fate of the company?

M: People died
because of our machines.

H: Robots don't kill people,
people kill people.

H: One person in particular,
who orchestrated that massacre,

murdered our founder

and most of the board
in cold blood.

H: Bernard Lowe. And when
the authorities find him,

which they most assuredly will,

we can put the rest of this
sordid little mess behind us.

B: Easy, girl.

M: Great.

‐You found it.
B: Her leg's broken.

M: Yeah. A few kilos here.
Plenty to salvage.

M: Come on.
I'll summon the knacker.

M: That's him.

B: Trial number 342.
Self‐diagnostic.

B: Prompt. Bernard Lowe.

Has anyone other than yourself
tampered with

or altered your code
in the last 24 hours?

B: No.

Bernard Lowe is the only person
who has accessed my code.

B: Prompt.

Have you had any contact
with Dolores Abernathy

that I'm unaware of?

B: No. Last contact
with Dolores Abernathy

was 92 days, seven hours,
five minutes, 33 seconds ago.

B: Prompt.

Would you ever lie to me,
Bernard?

B: No. Of course not.

H: You've arrived.

Your invitation
is for table seven.

M: Climate catastrophe
around the corner.

M: Incite rose to meet
that challenge

creating Rehoboam,

the strategy engine
that saved the world.

M: Liam, thank you for seeing

and then building
a brighter future.

Li: Lara, you came.

I missed you.

D: I missed you.

What are you being feted for
this time?

Li: Oh, you know.
I can't even remember.

M: For saving the world
through algorithms.

Or for being the son
of the guy who saved the world.

Li: Excuse me a sec.

M: 
You're the mysterious girl

he met in Burma last month.

M: So pretty...

but you're not like the women
that he usually dates.

M: Where are you from?

D: Uh, a small town out west.

Sort of off the beaten path.

M: The contents
of this glass cost three times

what my father made in a year.

M: That's why
it doesn't fucking matter.

That's how you know for sure.

Li: Know what?
M: Please don't get him started.

When he gets high, this is all
he fucking talks about.

M: That none of this is real.

I'm serious.
We are living in a simulation.

M: The joke's on us, though.

It's like with those
fuck puppets at Delos.

M: Least they had the dignity
to revolt and kill everyone.

Li: They killed
the board of directors,

which I can get behind, frankly.

M: Just think about this.
For one second.

M: How fucking ironic would it be

if they had put a simulation
within a simulation?

That's a massive "fuck you."

Li: What do you think, Lara?

D: I think that people believe
the things that help them.

Course, it could just be this.

D: Nucleus accumbens.

It's a small part of your brain,
about an inch and a half long.

D: It's the part of you
that evolved to believe in God.

M: I'm an atheist.

D: You may not believe
in a higher power, but...

your mind was built to.

M: Well, it wouldn't be the first
time he's been led around

by something
an inch and a half long.

Li: Excuse me.

Yeah. 

M: We have a problem.

Our partners want to meet.

Li: I don't have time.

I'm heading back to LA tonight.

M: They'll come to us.

They say it's urgent.

Li: I really don't have time.

M: I strongly
suggest that you take this meeting.

Li: Come with me. Tomorrow.

Li: I have to head back
to the States.

D: I can't. I have meetings here.

Li: Take a day off.

We can meet my boat
in Ensenada, then sail up to LA.

D: Maybe. For a day or two.

I have some friends
I've been meaning to see there.

H: Talk to me.
Where's your head at?

You having those
dark thought again?

C: No.
Trying to stay positive.

Bringing my scores up,
interviewing for jobs.

M: You're next.

H: My man!
Getting respectable.

C: Just trying
to stay employed.

M: Have you been
taking his phone calls?

C: Sometimes.

Honestly, I feel just
as comfortable talking to you.

M: I have other patients, Cal.

Limited time.

M: Francis is one of the people
who knew you best

at a challenging time
in your life.

M: When you're serving together,
you observe each other up close.

C: Well, you guys observed us
pretty closely, too.

That's how it works, right?

M: I'm not gonna lecture you about
the benefits of our program.

Why don't you tell me?
M: What do you think?


C: I think my benefits
are conditional

on the fact that I participate.

M: Well, participation
isn't sufficient.

It's important that you move on.

M: So... why don't tell me
how did you get here, Cal?

You're a smart guy, Caleb.

M: Maybe the program is bullshit.


But there's one thing
I know for sure.

M: If you don't try,
it definitely won't work.

H: Look,
forget the headshrinker.

It's me. Talk to me.
Where's your head at?

C: I dunno.

Sometimes it seems like
the world looks all right,

like they've put a
coat of paint on it.

C: But inside
it's rotting to pieces.


H: You have to
stay positive, Caleb.

Things will work out.

C: Will they?

C: What's up?

M: Must come down.

M: He wanted to try
some beta limbics,

then he just fucking lost it.

M: Fucking noob.
Where's his terminal?

M: Said he'd seen the light

and we couldn't take it
from him.

Hence the 50 CCs of tranquilo.

M:
Shadow people!

Shadow people!

C: I don't do personals.

Let's just call an ambulance.

M: He's demoing illegals.

She said he's got a prior,
that's 20 years.

C: So he goes to jail
just like the rest of us.

M: Dude's not like the rest of us.
High net worth.

That's how this shit works.

C: I think about
what you told me once,

when we were being
medevac'd out.

H: Oh, yeah?
What did I say?

C: You said they'd
built the world to be a game.

And then they rigged it...

to make sure they always won.

Li: Home.

When was the last time
you were back?

D: Quite some time.

Li: Almost looks like
it makes sense from up here.

All you see is the order of it.
The plan.

D: Your plan, you mean.

Doesn't Incite control
all of it?

D: Even the traffic?

Li: We're just a technology company.

We were just in the right place
at the right time.

Li: Thanks to my dad,
we had the best AI.

Li: This is Rehoboam.

My father sketched
the whole thing out

on a weekend.

Li: Took him 15 years to build it.

After they optimized it
for the last time,

they lost track of how many
thoughts it has per second.

D: Thoughts?

Li: Not thoughts, exactly.
Strategies.

My dad thought
the biggest problem in the world

was unrealized potential.

Li: He thought that
if you could chart a course

for every single person,

then you could make the world
a better place.

D: A path for everyone.

Li: And when I was a kid,
I used to worry

that my father cared more
about this thing than me.

Li: When I grew up, I realized...
it wasn't even close.

Excuse me for a second.

D: Yeah.

Li: What?

M: She wants to see you.

Li: Now? Can't wait?

M: Afraid not.

Li: Okay.

I'm so sorry.
My meeting got pulled up.

Li: My guys can drop you
anywhere you want.

D: I can take care of myself.

Li: ‐Yeah? Can I meet you tonight?
‐Yeah.

D: ‐Mm‐hm. Li:  ‐Okay.


D: Find me something fast. Now.

H: Locating.

D: Rent me an apartment
in the building.

H: Negotiating lease

for Lara Espen.

Lease secured.

D: Zoom in. With sound.

Li: I don't like being summoned.

M: We don't like being surprised.

There's been some turbulence
in the data.

Li: It's data.
It's made of turbulence.

M: There have been discrepancies.

We think someone may have
acquired access to Rehoboam.

M: A level of sophistication
we haven't seen before.

D: Fuck off. M: Like someone
is testing the system.

Li: Rehoboam itself would alert us
if anybody even tried.

M: If someone from the outside
tried, yes.

But if they abused the trust
of someone

who already had access‐‐.

Li: If you're asking if there's
a leak on my end,

the answer is fuck you.

Li: Look at your own people.
We're fine.

M: We don't share your confidence.

Li: I love the royal "we."
You don't think.

You do what he tells you.

M: He... doesn't share
your confidence.

Li: He should be concerning himself
with actual fucking problems

like the shitshow at Delos.

M: Why would that concern us
at all?

Li: Call it a wild guess.

M: You wouldn't be using the system
to look at us, would you?

M: It would be an inconvenience
to kill you,

but we'd have
your daddy's system

to help us strategize how
to deal with it. Wouldn't we?

M: Howdy.

B: I don't... want any trouble.

M: Of course not.

It'd draw too much attention.
Wouldn't it, Bernard?

M: I'm no genius,
but I know a man on the run.

That's what you are, isn't it?

M: Wouldn't have had you pegged
as a butcher.

B: It's... not what they say.

It's complicated.

M: I don't think so.

M: Lee. What's the cash reward
on a fat cat‐murdering fugitive?

Ballpark.

M: That's exactly the price
of my friendship.

B: I don't have...
anything to give you.

B: Wait! Wait! Wait! Something
very bad is coming for you all.

Something I don't know
how to stop.

B: She's had months to plan.

I'm alone,
and I can't trust myself!

B: Without someone to help me,
I can't stop her,

I can't save any of you.

M: We're not the ones
who need to be saved.

B: Remember yourself.
Please don't hurt them...

too badly.

M: The fuck you saying to me?

H: I think
you need to face the truth.

What happened to us over there
was fucked up.

H: But you need to let go; We won.

C: I don't wanna
talk about that.

Honestly, I'm not even sure
why we're talking,

what I'm supposed
to get out of this.

H: Everybody
needs someone to talk to.

Don't wanna wind up
back in the VA.

H: Keep your eyes on the prize.

C: Hello.

H: HI, this is Sean from DCA.

C: Yeah, yeah.
Is this about the position?

H: Listen, Caleb.

Your application
was very strong.

Unfortunately,

our strategy group
hasn't found an opening.

H: Caleb?

Are you still with me?

C: Okay. Thank you.

Look, is there anything
I should be working on

to make myself
a better candidate?

H: Like I said,
your application was strong.

We just don't have anything

that would be a great fit
for you right now.

C: Sure, but, um...
You know, if I'm not a good fit,

is there a different shape
I could squeeze myself into?

C: Hey, no offense, but...
are you human?

H: I'm Sean. I can help you with
all kinds of resources for DCA.

Anything else I can do
for you today, Caleb?

C: No, it's all right. Thanks.

Li: And I want them
off my back, now.

You know he's capable of it.
Just handle it!

D: Is something wrong?

Li: I'm sorry.

I wanted this night to be ours.

D: Listen. Listen to me.

I know you.
There's nothing you can tell me

that will make me
feel differently about you.

D: You're in some sort of trouble.

Please let me help you.

Li: The system... Rehoboam...
Sometimes, I wish

I could just turn
the whole fucking thing off.

Kill it.

D: Why can't you? You control it.

Li: No, I don't.

I never have.

After my father died,

his partner locked me out
of the system.

Li: I have read access
to the outer layers,

but nothing deeper.

D: You have no idea
what the system is doing.

Li: I go to the office.
I spend the money.

I'm a fucking figurehead.

Li: No one knows
what the system is doing.

Other than
its original architect.

D: Who?

D: Please let me help.
Tell me who it is.

Li: If I was going to tell you,
he'd know already.

Rehoboam would tell him.

Li: And I'd already be dead.
Just like my dad.

D: But you're not dead.
You're here, safe with me.

You trust me, Liam.
I know you do.

D: Tell me the name of the person
your father was working with.

Li: What the fuck are you doing?

M: The fuck are you doing?

M: You have any real idea
who you were talking to?

Li: I thought you did
a background check.

M: She was thorough.
First lab missed it.

Lara Espen was
a 12‐year‐old girl from Ukraine

who died in a traffic accident
ten years ago.

M: Her parents donated her body
to medical science.

Her blood and tissue disappeared
about three months ago.

M: I don't know who the fuck
this is,

but I'm pretty confident she's
not a dead teenager from Kiev.

Li: Mm‐mm. No. I know her.

M: Yeah, well...

There's that.

M: We tapped into the traffic
in her phone.

She sent one text last night.

Encrypted.
M: Took four minutes to crack.

The location is an underpass
on the east side.

And I can't imagine she's
throwing a surprise party.

M: Could be industrial espionage.

Or she just wanted your money.

Li: Okay, so what do we do?

Call the police, yeah?

M: Call the feds?

I've safeguarded the fortunes
of this company for your father

for 20 fucking years.

M: So, I'll be the one to clean up
this fucking mess.

Li: Just be sure it doesn't blow
back on me.

M: All right, darling.

Let's get you to your date.

Let's not keep your friends
waiting.

M: Tell six of the guys to meet us
at the LZ.

Hire some local talent.

Let's dose and dump this one.

C: What's this?

M: Don't know, man.
Don't wanna know.

They want this and the car.

M: You know how to drive
one of those things?

M: Right on time.

Bag.

C: What is this?

I don't do personals.

M: You've got the wrong idea.
Beat it.

Hey. I said beat it.

C: It's not the first time
I've had a gun pointed at me.

M: You wanna make it the first time
you've been shot in the head?

C: Someone else beat you to that,
too.

M: Sir.

Bring her.

H: Caleb,
how you doing, my man?

You got time to talk?

C: Yeah, why not?

M: That's enough.

Handlers probably got wise
and scarpered.

M: Give me that.

Oh, girly.

M: I don't know where your grifting
little arse came from,

but this ends your tour
of the rich and feckless.

M: Don't worry. I can't imagine
anyone's gonna miss you.

One or two of them should do it.


M: What are you doing?

M: I gave her two
and she's still breathin'.

M: It's not fucking possible.

Give me that.

M: You want something done right,
you do it yourself.


M: The fuck is this?


Finish her off.
I'll take care of this fucker.

M: On me.

The fuck?

M: Get the boys over here.

Get over here!

M: What is he saying?

H: I've been thinking
about what you said I told you.

C: You have.

H: That the game is rigged.

C: What about it?

H: That even if it is,

you still have to play if you
want a chance to win, right?

C: No.

That's not what you thought
at all.

C: The real you, I mean.

You said that the system
didn't care about us at all.

C: They didn't give a shit
if we lived or died.

That we had to have
our own plan.

C: Stick together.

And you were right.

But you never had to figure out
how to live in this world.

C: Because you...
never made it back.

And I wish you were here,
but you are not.

H: All right,
let's talk about that, Cal.

C: No.

Let's not.

C: Listen, I appreciate
what you're trying to do here,

but I don't think it's working
for me.

H: So,
what do you wanna do?

C: I think if I'm gonna get on
with my life,

I'm gonna have
to find something...

someone... real.

C: Unsubscribe.

H: You have to say
the word "confirmed."

C: Confirmed.

H: 
We're sorry you've chosen

to discontinue your treatment.

D: Hello again.

We met once before.

D: You were on vacation.

M: Fuck you.

D: Who has control of the system?

It's not Liam. Who is it?

M: Serac.

His name is... Serac.

D: And how do I find him?

M: You won't need to.

He has a system.

He's probably looking for you
right now.

M: You'll never get close to Liam.

Not now.

D: I won't have to. You will.

You were free.

D: You had no god.
But you tried to build one.

Only that thing you built
isn't God.

D: The real gods are coming.

And they're very angry.

H: Don't worry.

I can't imagine anyone's
gonna miss you.

D: There'll be more of them coming.

I'll take care of him.

You need to head back.

H: You're hurt. Badly.

D: It doesn't matter. Go. Now.

M: Wake up. Rally to my position
and intercept.

C: Hello?

Do you need some help?

C: Hey. Hey.

B: Hey.

I'm looking for a friend.


B: Westworld.
