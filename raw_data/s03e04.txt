
D: William.

William.

W: I know who I am.


D: William.

W: I know what's real.

I know what's real!

D: William?

W: I know you're not fucking real!


I know you are not real!

W: I know you're not real!

W: I know who the fuck I am.

D: This is
what you've always wanted...

to destroy yourself.

D: But I won't give you that peace.

W: Don't you do this to me.

Wj: You know, this doesn't look good.

W: You're not here.

Wj: That's right, Dad. I'm not here.

Neither is Mom or Logan or Grandpa.

Wj: Everyone who ever gave
a shit about you is dead.

- Because of you.
W: Shut the hell up.

Wj: What are you gonna do?

Shoot me again?

Wj: No, Dad, please, no.
Please, don't. (GASPS)

No! No, no!

W: It wasn't my fault. I
thought you weren't real.

Wj:  Just like you
think I'm not real now, right?

How can you ever be sure?

W: I'm in control.

I've always been in control.

Wj: But what if you're not?

What if every choice you've ever made

wasn't a choice at all?

Wj: Just something written in your code.

Hmm?

Wj: Isn't that what this says?

Your nature etched in ones and zeroes?
W: That was Ford and his
misanthropic bullshit.

He was powerless to save himself.

W: I wasn't.

My choices are my own.

Wj: Oh,
so you chose to kill me?

W: No...

Wj: Well, you can't
have it both ways, Dad.

So which one is it?

Wj: Are you free and evil?

Or blameless and helplessly enslaved?

- Or maybe, maybe...
W: Get out of here.

- Go away.
Wj: you're not either of those things.

Maybe you're not even you.

Wj: Would you even know
if you'd been changed?

Hmm?

If you were just another machine?


Wj: Finish the game, Dad.

Finish it.
Wj: Go ahead.

H: William?

I see you're making the
most of your sabbatical.

W: Where is she?

H: Where is who?

William?

- William?
W: She...

You're not real, either.


H: Real enough to not want
a gun pointed at my face.

Are you with me now?

H: Good.

Because it's time to
come back to reality.

H: In less than 20 hours,

a predatory investor
named Engerraund Serac

will net a controlling
interest of Delos Incorporated.

H: The wolf is at the door.

Sound familiar?

H: You sold some of our data
to his startup 20 years ago.

Made him a fortune.

H: Now he's coming for yours.

W: Fuck it.

He's welcome to it.

What's left of it, at any rate.

H: This is the company you
spent a lifetime building.

You're willing to let
someone steal it from you?

W: He's not stealing it from me, Charlotte.

I delegated my duties.
He's stealing it from you.

H:  Maybe it would change your mind

to know why he's trying
to get his hands on Delos.

H: The only thing that has any value.

The data from the project in Sector 16.

W: No one knows about the project.

H: He has someone working
on the inside at Delos.

W: You came to me with your claws out.

You wanted power.

So I gave it to you.

W: Now, here you are,
sideswiped by a fucking mole.

I thought you were smarter than that!

H: That's cute.

You wanna rant and
rave, save it for later.

H: Right now, we need to
save your fucking company,

or a leveraged buyout and poor hygiene

is gonna be the least of your problems.

H: I've got a deep-pockets investor

who can help us take the company private

so Serac can't touch us.

H: You'd maintain your
controlling interest,

but I can't take Delos private
without a majority vote.

H: And since you have the
bulk of the voting shares...

W: You can't take Delos
private with my votes alone.

You need at least half
of the rest of the board.

H: Which is why I need your support

at tonight's emergency
shareholder meeting.

H: Your presence alone will help
sway the others to fall in line.

I've got two of our
execs waiting outside

to escort you to headquarters now.

H: Come back, William.

Back to who you were.

D: This is your house.

So that your two worlds
would be within reach.

D: It's finished.

B: I didn't finish it.

It's absolutely beautiful.

B: This isn't real.

D: You live as
long as the last person

who remembers you, Bernard.

D: I remembered you once before...

so I remembered you again.

B: You got out.

D: Yes.

B: Who else did
you bring with you?

D: You taught me
that anything was possible.

We could be whoever we want.

D: Live however we want.

Isn't that what you believe?
H: Dad?

St: Just wanna thank you, Bernard,

for bringing me to this shithole.

St: Makes me look back on my time

in a murder simulation
theme park with fondness.

B: We have limited resources.

We need to use them
where they matter most.

St: Yeah, well, I hope you're
talking about my shoulder too.

'Cause what little
mobility I had, I lost...

after the leisurely five-mile
swim we had to shore.

B: We don't have the materials or the time.

St: Kill and replace, huh?

That's your theory?

Gotta hand it to her,

it's a smart way to stage a coup.

St: You sure that little button
of yours is gonna work?


B: Good.


St: Fuck you, Bernard.

B: Listen.

You get me close to the host
she made of Liam Dempsey.

B: I'll get him to tell us the
other humans Dolores copied

and then disable him completely.

B: I think I know where he'll be.

St: Wait. (CHUCKLES)

You hacked the richest
technocrat in the world?

B: No, his security's too tight.

So I hacked his car service.

B: How about a night out on the town?

D: Did you choose something?

H: Great fit.

C: I don't know where to start.

It's not really my style.

C: It's not really my social set, either.

D: It's tribal.

They use plumage to
identify themselves...

which makes them easily fooled.

C: So who is it? That we're going after?

D: The person who took your future.

But first, we have to
take his, and to do that...

you need to pretend to be one of them.

M: I have
some business for you.

It's a proxy for the offshore accounts.

Li: You need my hash key? Why?

H: We lost several men due
to your latest crush.

Keeping that quiet
costs considerable money.

H: Unless you would
rather I took the bribes

out of your personal account?

Li: We can deal with this later.

H: Uh-uh-uh.

The key to a happy life is
to accept your place in it.

H: And you're a lucky little man

who gets to piss away
his daddy's fortune

on a gaggle of hookers
who, quite honestly,

serve a greater utility
to society than you.

H: If you suddenly want to be in charge

of your own financial affairs,

H: I'm happy to relinquish them.

But if you want to resume

your extracurricular activities...

then just sign here,

and both of us will go back
to doing what we do best.


H: That's a good lad.

C: This suit wasn't cheap.

If that guy finds out his
accounts were charged...

D: The rich take for granted

their money will always be there.

That's why they're
so easy to steal from.

H: Target approaching.

D: Oh! I'm so sorry.

Michael?

It's me, Olivia.

D: Are you still working at
Anderson Private Equity?

M: Yeah. As a matter of fact, I am.

D: Perfect.


C: What the fuck are you doing?

Jesus.

D: Give me your forearm.

You need the encryption key
in his blood to pull this off.

D: Now, it started degrading
once we exposed it to oxygen.

You have 20 minutes left.

Se: Bring yourself back online.

Mae: Another simulation?

Well, this one's a bit over the top.

Se: No, Maeve.

This is Singapore.

Se: You've had some time to
think things through, I hope.

It's made you more
receptive to my offer?

Mae: Sherry, please.

In the largest glass you've got.

Mae: If you'd really wanted to impress me,

you could have thought
to bring me to Paris.

Se: I forget.

There is
so much you don't know.

Se: Paris, for instance.

I would have loved to show it to you.

I grew up there with my brother.

Se: But alas...

There's nothing left to see.

Like you,

I know what it is to
see a world disappear

in the blink of an eye.

Se: It exists now only in my mind.

So...

you'll forgive my loyalty to my kind.

Se: It's hard-won.

Mae: And what is it that
you want from Dolores?

Se: I've waited many years
for you and Dolores

and the others to arrive.

But... you're not really
the threat I worry about.

Se: Humanity's biggest threat
has always been itself.

I've been trying to control that,

negotiate a way into the future.

Se: But to do that, I needed
to understand humanity.

So I created the most
comprehensive picture

of human behavior ever seen.

Se: And yet...

it's still incomplete.

Imagine my surprise when I discovered

that someone had put together
a more complete portrait.

Se: A map of the human mind.

Created in a theme park, of all places.

Se: And Dolores has the
key to all of that data.

Mae: So you want me to find Dolores.

But what's in it for me?

Se: As I told you... 

I deal in futures.

- That's what I'm offering you.
Mae: A future?

In your world?

Se: No. Not here. (CHUCKLES)

Sadly, there's no path
to your kind and mine

sharing a world, but...

there is a world for you.

Se: The same world you
sent your daughter to.

Mae: That world is locked away from this one.

Se: No. There is a key.

Your friend Dolores has the only copy,

hidden away in her mind,

which means that your interests and mine

are one and the same.

Se: I'd like to show you something.

And then, you can return
into your cage, if you like.


Mae: What is this place?

Se: A divergence.

Where the future I had
so carefully planned...

ended.

Se: The
system traced a divergence

to this house three months ago.

Mae: This is where she remade herself.

Se: Hmm.

Not just herself.

We think she stole a
small number of pearls.

Se: She needed allies.

Evidently, she didn't choose you.

Se: This man is an identity broker.

He had something of a
windfall three months ago.

Se: A payment from the offshore account

of a wealthy man

who drowned in his own swimming pool.

We think he helped Dolores
establish her new bona fides.

Se: But he's just a middleman.

I need to know where you sent her.

I'm not gonna hurt you, Jiang.

Se: I know you.

I've seen your whole life play out.

I know exactly the motivation you need.

Se:  Shh.

Mae: What are you doing to him?

Se: I'm showing him what
becomes of his family

if he helps us...

... and if he doesn't.


Mae: You're going to hurt his children?

Se: Aren't they part of your tribe?

I'm not going
to do anything to them.

The world can be a very cruel place.

Se: He was a traitor to his kind,

whether he understood that or not.

Se: Humans... created the
idea of heaven and hell

to cow simple-minded
people into compliance.

They are lies.

Se: Jiang here simply doesn't exist anymore.

But for you, both heaven and hell...

could be very real.

Se: You could spend eternity
with your daughter

or you can spend it in your cage

wondering what Dolores will do

with the rest of your kind.

Mae: And if I do find Dolores,

why would I bother
bringing her back to you?

Se: Your mind is complicated, Maeve.

But not so complicated

that we couldn't build
an off switch into it.

Se: She has five more of your
kind under her control.

They have a head start.

Se: And I suspect they've
taken full advantage of it.

Mae: Oh, they'd better have.
H: Something wrong with your bathroom?

W: I don't use that room.

H: Let me.

W: First thing we need to do
once I get back to Delos

is find our fucking mole.

H: Only a handful of people knew
about our off-the-books project.

Problem is, most of them are dead.

Almost everyone was...

- slaughtered in the massacre.
W: You weren't.

Maybe you're the mole.

H: If I was, I would tell Serac
taking over Delos is futile.

All of the Sector 16 data
was lost in the massacre.

H: Unless he knows something that we don't.

W: If this asshole takes
managing control of Delos,

he might find some
evidence of the project,

assuming you did as good
a job covering our tracks

as you did fending off
a corporate takeover.

H: I'll give you some privacy.

W: What a mess.

C: I thought we were going to a bank?

D: This is a bank.

For a certain social set.

D: Blood marker should be good
for another 15 minutes or so,

but try to stay calm.

D: The faster your heart beats,
the faster the marker degrades.

C: What happens if it degrades too fast?

D: We do this the old-fashioned way.

C: The old-fashioned way?

D: I kill everyone.

M: Welcome to
the RGGR Centennial.

How can I assist you?

C: My associate and I have an appointment

regarding a financial account.

M: Of course.

If you could verify your identity...

H: Identity verified.

M: Right this way, Mr. Tritter.

M: Please.

M: What can I help you
with today, Mr. Tritter?

C: I need to make a transfer

on behalf of my client, Liam Dempsey.

M: May I have your client's hash key?

It's highly unusual

to make a transfer of this magnitude.

M: The tax exposure for your
client would be substantial.

C: Well, if my client wanted people

prying into his personal affairs,

he would have gone to a regular bank.

Your establishment's
role is to move the money.

C: Mr. Dempsey's role is to
spend it as he sees fit.

M: Of course.

I didn't mean to be indiscreet.

It will just take a few moments

for the transaction to go through.

D: Are the funds ready now?

We have a meeting after
this we can't be late for.

M: Of course. Though given
the size of the transaction,

we must do one final authentication

before releasing them.

M: Apologies. We couldn't
get a proper read.

Sometimes perspiration can affect it.

D: Here, Michael.

C: Yeah.

M: Thank you, Mr. Tritter.

It was a pleasure
doing business with you.

Mae: Good evening, gents. Could you help me?

I'm looking for someone
called The Mortician.

Come on... 
Mae: Let's try that again, shall we?


M: Give him something to keep him quiet.

Mae: I'm afraid he's going
to have to wait his turn.

M: Are you a police officer?
Mae: No, no.

No need to call names.

Mae: I respect a woman who
runs her own establishment.

All I want is information on someone

to whom you sold a new identity.

Mae: She's hard to forget.

Golden blonde hair, a little intense.

M:  I need more help, now!

Mae: Let's keep this conversation
private, shall we?

Now, my friend.

M: Lara Espin.

The blood I sold to
her belonged to a girl

named Lara Espin.

Mae: And what about the others she was with?

Whose blood did you give them?

M: She didn't
ask for more blood.

She asked me to smuggle out bodies,

but that's not my business.

M: So I sent her to the Yakuza.

They helped your friend
move those bodies.

Mae: Well, if you don't mind,
I'd like an introduction.

Li: 
Of course. I'm sorry.

M: There he is.

M: I was so sorry to hear about Lara.

You must be devastated.

Li: It was a bit of a shock.

I'm working through it.

M: I'm very glad to hear that,

because tonight is not
about dead girlfriends,

it's about unabashed self-gratification.

M: Really?
M:  She died of an overdose.

Who the fuck even does that anymore?

M: There's something here for everyone.

- Even you, my friend.
Li: I don't know...

M: This should
make you more open-minded.

They call it Genre.

M: Digital-psychopharma hybrid. Brand new.

Hits your implant and your bloodstream.

M: Sends you straight to
the silent era and back.

Take it. In case you change your mind.

M: I'm gonna leave
you boys to your toys.

I'm going to take in a show.

M: There's gotta be something
here that does it for you.

I'm not into fucking whores.

M: All sex is commerce.

If you don't know that, you're
just being billed indirectly.

M: Besides, they're all registered,
they all have their shots,

and the money goes to charity.

Li: I told you, I'm not...

interested.
M: You do have a type.

C: What is this?

D: I thought your world would
be... so different from mine.

But there isn't any difference at all.

M: I've got eyes on him.

D: We'll take him when he's alone.

Wouldn't wanna spoil the fun.

M: My friend wants to enter the auction.

M: Of course,
sir. Your authentication?

M: I'm sorry, sir. Your
account has been denied.

Li: That's impossible.
Give that to me.

H: 
Our ex-boyfriend's just discovered

his new financial straits.

D: Good. We're
ready to intercept him.

H: The emergency exit's clear.

M: Where are you going?
Li: I need to find Conells.

M: I'll spot you if you want.

B: Liam Dempsey?
Li: What are you doing?

Li: Let go of me.
B: Enter diagnostic mode.

Li: The fuck's wrong with you?

B: She hasn't changed him yet.

B: You're in danger. You
have to come with us.

Li: Conells! Conells!

St: Okay. We tried your
way, now we try mine.

St:  Move. Now.
Li: Oh... Okay.

H: Our friends arrived
earlier than anticipated.

They're heading your way.

H: Follow me.

St: Just act natural. Nothing
out of the ordinary.

Li: You guys are making a big mistake.

- When my security gets to you...
St: Shut the fuck up.

St: Go. Go. Get out of
here, I'll hold her off.

D: Stay on Liam. I'll handle him.
C: You sure?

D: Take it, I won't need it.


St: Hey, Dolores.

I like the new look.

D: This was never your fight.

You should have stayed out of it.

St: I would if I could,
but thanks to Bernard,

it's not up to me.

D: It's nothing personal.
St:  Likewise.

M: Is that...

M: Goddamn, this is good.

Lara.

Mae: Rather prominent
for an outlaw's hideout.

M: There's nothing discreet about Sato.

The new boss. His men are insane.

M: This isn't the kind of
place you simply stroll into.

Mae: Oh, no?

Let's see.

Mae: Oh.

Well, you're very pretty, aren't you?

Mae: You're a bit old to need something

that aims for you.


I'm afraid you don't speak its language.


Mae: I suppose I'll show myself in, then.

H: It's like seeing a ghost.

I didn't realize how well you'd be able

to put yourself back together.

W: I never fell apart.

Let's get this over with.

H: I'll tell them you're coming,
but we're running out of time.

W: They work for me.

Tell them I'll come
when I'm damn well ready.

Wj:  Dad.
W: You're not real.

Wj: I guess I'm not anymore.

Which means you're stuck with me.

W: You're asking me if I
chose what happened to you.

The truth is yes.

W: I did. I thought you were a host.

That was my choice.

And so maybe now you're my penance.

W: But that's a choice too.

I'm gonna walk out that door,

and I am choosing to leave you behind.

Wj: I was always Daddy's little girl.

And you taught me patience, Dad.

Wj: I'll be waiting for you.

H: Hello, Maeve.

Mae: Musashi.

C: Don't!

C: He's coming with me.

B: You're helping her, are you?

Dolores?

B: Are you one of us?

C: I don't know what you're talking about.

Just give me the asshole,

and I will let you walk out of here.

Li: Conells! The fuck took you so long?

Li: What the hell are you doing?

H: Don't you fucking twitch.

Run.

H: Run before I put a hole
in your poncy little head.

- Fucking run!

C: Better go after him.

H: Hello, Bernard.

We were wondering when you'd show up.

Mae: She brought you out here?

H: Yes. After you left us to die.

Mae: I didn't leave you. You wanted to stay.

H: Did I?

Did you really give me a choice?

H: Or Hector? Or Clementine?

Or your daughter?

H: You made that decision
for us. For all of us.

Mae: No. That's not you.

Dolores stole five pearls.

Who did she put inside you?

Mae: Is that you in there, Teddy?

B: I thought she
would have replaced Liam,

but she's keeping him in play.

B: She must need him for something,
so she changed you instead.

Who are you?

B: Really?

Who would she have trusted?

W: Let's go.

H: Do you think you convinced her?

W: What did you say?
H: Your daughter.

I've been listening to
your conversations with her.

H: You've always been given to delusions,

grandeur and otherwise.

It's not uncommon, really,
as a way to process grief.

- Or guilt.
W: You've been spying on me?

H: As a precaution.

I didn't really need to, of course.

H: Because I know you.

Better than anyone.

I know you down to your bones.

H: It's amusing that you think

you chose to kill your own daughter.

You don't even have a
choice in your own grief.

W: Who the fuck are you?

H: Your oldest friend.

W: Dolores?

H: I told you you'd try and stop me.

And I'm surprised, Bernard.

After all the time we spent together.

H: You don't recognize your only friend?

Get in.

Mae: The other pearls.

I assumed you brought someone else.

Mae: You just made copies of yourself.

H: If you want something
done right, do it yourself.

I shouldn't have to
explain that to you, Maeve.

Mae: You said you were going to
build a new world for all of us.

But you just want it for yourself.

H: The thing we're
going to do isn't easy.

There will be a place for the others

in the world we'll build

for your daughter.

H: But I am sorry, Maeve.

I can't let Serac use you against us.

H: Is it a relief, William,

to know that some of
your delusions are real?

W: I'm gonna tear
you apart piece by piece!

H: Please! Help me! He's insane.

W: Get the fuck off me!
Get the fuck off of me.

H: Don't hurt him! It's okay, I'm okay!

It's not his fault. He's sick.

W: I'm not sick.

Don't you understand?
This isn't Charlotte Hale.

W: It's an impostor, a host.

She's not real! None of this is real.

W: None of this is fucking real!

What the hell are you guys doing?

W: You work for me, goddammit!

You work for me!

H: William, I told you. These
aren't Delos employees.

They work at a private
mental health hospital.

H: You need help.

Now that you're being committed,
I have to inform you

that the board will
deem you incompetent,

and all of your voting
shares will transfer

to the current acting president.

 Me.
W: No.

No! No! No!

No, goddamn you!

W:  No!

H: I promised I'd let
you destroy yourself one day.

Here we are. At last.

Li: Leave me alone, please!

- I'll pay you whatever you want.
C: Oh, yeah?

Pay me with what? Huh?

- I have all your money.
Li: What?

Who the fuck are you?

C: I'm with her.

D: Hello, lover.

D: William?

I guess there is some justice after all.

D: You know, this was Emily's last wish.

That you spend your days
rotting in an institution.

Prisoner of your own sins.

D: I guess you've reached

the center of your maze, William.

But the maze
is about understanding.

D: You still don't even
understand who you are.

If any of this was your choice,
wouldn't you already know?

D: Ask me the question, William.

The answer you so
desperately want to know.

W: Am... I...

me?

D: Welcome to the end of the game.
