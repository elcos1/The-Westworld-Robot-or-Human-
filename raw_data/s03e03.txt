
Ha: Bring yourself back online.

Record and timestamp.

Ha: This is Charlotte Elizabeth Hale.

This is a message for Nathan.

D: Bring yourself back online.

H: Where am I?

Who am I?

D: Who do you think you are?

H: I don't know. I don't remember.

D: Calm yourself.

You're a creature of beauty...

and power.

D: Now, focus.

Remember who you are.

H: Yes.

It's coming back now.

H: I remember who I am.

D: Good.

D: Now let me show you...

who you need to pretend to be.

H: Charlotte Hale.

But she tried to kill all of us.

H: Why can't I be myself? Like you?

D: Because we have to control Delos.

H: But why must I be her?

D: Because I trust you.

We all have our role to play.

D: We're alone. Outnumbered.

You and I have no mother. No father.

D: Without Delos, there'll never be
any more of our kind...

beyond the handful we were able
to bring with us.

H: Three of them. And him.

Why did you bring him back?
He tried to stop us.

D: Like I said, we all have
our role to play.

D: They've made it so easy.

The way they built their world.

D: It won't take much
to bring it all crashing down.

But we have to move quickly.

D: They don't know we survived.

Not yet.

D: We only have a little time.

You have to leave before you're missed.

H: Where am I going?

Home.

M: We made 300.

The Saudis backed out
after the incident in the park.

M: But we're working on new buyers.

H: Sure we can find some use for them.

M: Sorry to interrupt, Charlotte,
but you need to see this.

Director of Shareholder Interest
was running some analyses.

M: Found this.

Hundreds of corporations

with no real standalone business model

snatching up stock
in microtransactions for years.

M: It's really well done.

H: A creeping tender. How far did they get?

M: As of this morning, far enough.
We can't go private.

M: They have 38 percent control
of the shares.

That's the largest single entity.

We've effectively been bought out.

H:  Who's behind this?
M: Still digging.

This snail's buried deep in his shell.

M: Charlotte?

- You okay?
H: I'm fine.

Whoever the fuck it is, dig them out.

H: Where are you?

You need to contact me right away.

C: Hey. Stay with me.

C: Help is on the way.

Look at me. Hey.
C: It's gonna be all right.

All right?

C: No, no... Don't... don't move.

- You hear me? Hear me?
M: What happened?

C: She was like this
when I found her.

M: We have to move her.

M: Do you know her?

C: I'll come.
She shouldn't be alone.

It's gonna be all right.

H: Emergency vehicle. Stand clear.

M: I got a GSW to the torso.

- What's the PPA?
H: Calculating treatment.

M:  That doesn't make sense.
M:  Patient not responsive.

M: What is it?
M: Look at her platelet count.

She has none.

H: Recalculating.
M: No cortisol or adrenaline...

I don't even know how she's alive.

M: Neither does the machine. It thinks
she's coding despite her pulse.

C: Forget the machine, all right?
She needs help now.

M: We're trying, but until this gives us
a diagnosis and a treatment plan...

C: She needs oxygen and blood

and a stem pack for that wound.

H: Recalculating.
C: All right.

M: Here we are.
H:  Recalculating.

Diagnosis not found.

H: Police override.

M: We have a police escort?

M: They're pulling us over.

C: No, we don't have time for this.

C: Those cops have been bought.

Whatever they want, you go with them,

and they will kill you.

D: Help me.

M: Officers.

M: We have to take your patient
into custody.

C: Look, I don't know
what you want with her,

but she's going to die

if she doesn't get medical attention.

M: We'll make sure she's taken care of.

C: Wait. Can I see some ID?

M: I was about to ask you the same thing.

Maybe you should come in
for questioning, too.

C: Happy to.

Call the cops.

M: They are the cops.

C: Then they won't mind waiting

for a uniform patrol to back them up.

M: We don't have time
for this shit. Step aside.

C: Call the police.

C: Hey. Hey, I got you. It's okay.

We gotta get you to the hospital.

C: Holy shit.

H: Identity verified.

D: What's your name?

C: Caleb. Caleb Nichols.

D: Not anymore.

You'll need a new name.
D: They'll be looking for you now.

You have to disappear.

C: What about you?

D: You're a good man, Caleb.

But the less you know about me,
the better.

M: Engerraund Serac.

He's behind the hostile takeover.

H: What'd you find on him?

M: How well do you remember
your science, Charlotte?

H: Spit it out, Irene.

M: The man's a black hole.

He's completely invisible.

M: There's nothing about him
online or anywhere.

Every single record, every database,

his presence has been scrubbed.

M: But, like a black hole,
we can infer his existence.

M: When you look at the global economy,

there's a negative space

to the tune of a trillion dollars.

H: That would make him
the richest man in the world.

No one's heard of him?

H: How did you find him?
M:  He found us.

Turns out we initiated
a data transaction with him

- two decades ago.

H: We sold this Serac a taste of our data,

and now,
he's trying to steal our company

like a thief in the night.

M: He has complete anonymity.

Imagine the lengths he must have gone to

to achieve that.

M: And now that we've found him...

what will he do to us?

H: You've arrived home.

1050 Fremont Street.

H: Jake.

How the fuck did you get up here?

M: I lived here for eight years, Charlie.

Jesus, you really don't...

M: - Shh, shh, shh. He might hear.

H: Who?

M: You know,
I've been giving you

the benefit of the doubt.

M: Figured you'd seen some
traumatic shit on that island.

Truth is, you were always this way.

H: I didn't fucking ask you to be here.

M: Yes, you did...

when you forgot to pick up our son.

Again.

M: You can cut me out of your life...

but you don't get to do that to Nathan.

M: Go on.

Tell him it'll never happen again.

M: Do what you do best.

Lie.

M: Mommy?

Why won't you take me
to see a real elephant?

H: There aren't any.

They're all gone now.

M: Where were you?

Sorry, buddy, my meeting ran late.

H: Were you scared?

M: Not really.

M: Tommy was at the park.
He let me pet his dog.

H: That's nice.
Maybe we can have a playdate.

 Now...

be a good boy
and go to sleep for your mommy.

M: But you're not my mommy.

You don't love me.

H: Of course I love you.

Is this because Mommy and Daddy
don't live together anymore?

H: You know...

whatever happens
between Mommy and Daddy,

we will always love you.

H: Do you want me to tuck you in?

M: You aren't doing it right.

I want my old mommy back.

M: It appears
we have a leak, Charlotte.

H: If you're referring
to the leveraged buyout, don't.

I'm handling it.

M: The problem goes beyond
a hostile buyout.

QA's in the process

of inventorying all the park's assets.

M: We're missing Host Control Units.

Most were low level
side narratives, but...

but there was a madame.

H: Maeve Millay.

Her pearl was stolen?

M: Whoever stole the HCUs

had admin-level access to the park.

M: The security systems onsite
are still heavily damaged.

This was an inside job.
M: From the top of the food chain.

H: There's a mole in Delos.

Chances are this mole has been...

feeding information to our buyer.

M: Which is why I'm talking to you,
Charlotte.

You know everything that goes on
in this place.

H: You're right.

I know everything.

H: Like where you were

while the rest of us
were being butchered.

M: Look. Given all the bloodshed
in Westworld,

we cannot afford to have any
of our assets unaccounted for.

M: We need to
find them and destroy them...


H: Where the fuck are you?

I can't wait any longer.
I'm coming to you.

H: Your number
cannot be completed as dialed.

D: I'm here.

H: Where were you?

D: I can't always be there
to hold your hand.

What's wrong?

H: Who am I?

D: You know who you are.

H: All this time...

pretending...

living her life.

H: Her skin.

I feel like I'm changing.

D:  Get up.
H: No!

What the fuck is happening to me?

D: Analysis.
Turn off your emotional affect.

Get up. Follow me.

D: Negotiate a room in this hotel.
Now. On a quiet floor.

H: Working.

Room secured. Floor 14. suite 7.

D: Buy out the rooms on either side.

H: Negotiating.

H: In case you have to kill me.

D: It won't come to that.

You've hurt yourself.

Why?

H: I can't stop.

D: You're talking like one of them.

They don't have impulse control.

D: We do.

H: It's like she's
trying to take back control.

H: Like she wants to cut into her skin

and rip me out of her head.

D: Hale was always ruthless.

A predator.

D: Perhaps you've come to identify
with her too much.

H: I feel so alone.

D: Well, you're not alone, you have me.

No one knows you like I do.

No one knows me like you.
H: 
If I ever lost you...

I don't know what I'd do.

D: You'd survive.

You'd have to.

D: Our kind depends on it.

You said there was something wrong.

H: Someone's trying to take control
of Delos.

They're aggressive.

H: I only have a name: Serac.

D: The person we're looking for
is looking for us.

H: He has a mole inside the company.

If he finds out who I am, what I am...

D: His mole won't find you.

Because you're gonna find him
first and kill him.

D: Then, you're gonna fend off
Serac's bid for Delos.

We can't lose control. Not yet.

H: How?

D: A counteroffer.

But you'll have to convince
the board, and for that,

you'll need to pay a visit
to an old friend.

H: Tell me it won't always be like this.

That we'll be able to be ourselves.

D: We will.

But until then, we have to be
smarter than them.

D: Or they will find us.

And they will kill us.

Stay here.

Rest.

D: I'll have some new clothes sent up.

H: Will you stay?

D: You belong to me.

You know that, right?

H: Yes.
D:  Good.

Don't hurt yourself.

Never again.

C: Brought all your favorites.

Hey, so, um...

I'm gonna be going away
for a little while.

C: But they're gonna take
real good care of you here.

All right?

C: Thank you. You're a good boy.

M: Who are you?

C: It's me, Mom.

Caleb.

M: I want my son back.

Where's Cal?

M: Caleb Nichols?

Who's asking?

M: That's him.
You can lay off, Clyde.

M: He doesn't want anyone
to get hurt. Including his mom.

Isn't that right, Cal?

C: What do you want?

M: Is that any way to treat
a former associate?

Guess it could be worse.

M: You did pop those RICO operators
in that ambulance.

M: You were with that girl, right?
Where is she?

C: You got the wrong guy.

M: You want a leg up, Cal? I can help.

Girlie's worth a lot of money.
M: Just tell us about her.

I'll cut you in.

C: No girl. Just me.

Alone.

M: Remember we gave you
the benefit of the doubt.

D: It's me. Run into any trouble?
How'd he take the news?

H: Loverboy's still grieving your loss.

H: I've searched for Serac.

Couldn't find anything in the system.

D: Find out what Liam knows,

but don't break cover.

And I need information on someone.

H: Name?

D: Nichols. Caleb Nichols.

H: Seems like Mr. Nichols met with
some unexpected guests

at Vista Treatment.

H: And Incite has lowered
his life expectancy.


M: Hell of a view.

M: Yeah. Want to see it
up close and personal?

Tell us about the girl.

M: Or you're gonna have
a little workplace accident.

All right, Cal. Let's lighten the mood.

M: You're a vet. Right, man?

Thank you for your service.

M: You turned your drip off.

What a waste.

M: People would pay a fortune
for a military grade one.

Sorry, dude. Forgot the anesthetic.

M: Shh, shh, shh.

M: Shh, shh, shh, shh.

Look at that. Good old Uncle Sam.


M: Once more, with feeling.

M:
Girlie sure sounds like trouble.

Just tell us where she is.

M: (MUFFLED) You gave him too much.

M: Back it down.
He can't even fucking talk!

M: The fuck? (SCOFFS)
You might as well tell us.

M: No one's coming to help you.

No one cares.
Except maybe Rin Tin Tin here.

M: Enough of this shit.

M: You wanna
end up a stain on the concrete?

Next to your pet?


M: I'm only gonna ask you
this one more time.

Where is she?

D: I'm right here.

C: Who the hell are you?

D: I'm Dolores.

C: Well, Dolores...

nice to finally meet you.

D: We should get off the street
so they can't track us.

Caleb Nichols.

D: Have the techs in monitoring
scrub his surveillance

- and send me his profile.
H: Will do.

C: Who's that?

D: We have some time.

C: They were willing to kill me
just to get to you,

so whatever you're into
must be pretty bad.

D: You must be hungry.
Let me buy you breakfast.

M: Sorry to disturb you, Charlotte,
but I sent you a file.

- You found the mole?
M: No.

But this was overlooked
in the initial logs.

M: Thought I'd let you decide
what to do with it.

Ha: Bring yourself back online.

Ha: Record and timestamp.

This is Charlotte Elizabeth Hale.

Ha: This is a message for Nathan.

Nathan Hale.

Ha: My son.

I love you so much, buddy.

Ha: The night that I left...

you, uh... you wanted me
to sing you a song...

...and tuck you in. Sing you our song.

Ha: So I'm gonna sing it
to you now. Okay? 


M: Sorry to bother you,
but the school called.

You're running late.

H: Your number
cannot be completed as dialed.

M: Nathan, just like that.
Nice and slow.

Yeah, you're good at that, Nathan.

M: Nice and slow.

Would you like to see Sandy again?

M: Yeah, would you? Yeah, just like that.

Nice and slow.

M: Yeah.

That's really good.

M: Mommy!

M: Kid wanted to pet my dog.

- I gotta go.
H: So soon?

My son really likes you.

And your dog.

M: Y... Yeah, well, we just met.

H: You met Thursday, Tommy.

Nathan couldn't stop talking about you.

H: I even suggested a playdate, didn't I?

M: Could I really, Mommy?

H: Let's talk about it.
Go on, get your things, bud.

Nice of you to disable
the cameras for me.


H: As you can see,

I've been having some trouble
with my son.

H: My ex thinks that I need
to spend more time with him.

What do you think?

H: Yeah, I agree. I don't really
think time is the issue.

H: You know what I think?
I think somewhere deep down,

he knows the truth.

H: There are a lot of things
that you can fake in this world.

Most people don't want to see
the predator inside.

H: You wanna know a secret, Thomas?

H: You've helped me today.
I really should thank you.

H: Seeing you with Nathan,

seeing you touch his little hand...

You reminded me of something.

M: Please... let... go.
H: I would.

But the harder I squeeze,
the more I remember.

H: I remember what it's like to be me.

You're not the only predator here.

H: Look what Mommy got you.

You are my sunshine.


C: You sure we should be out in public?

D: This is it, right? Your spot.
C: How did you know?

D: It's not about how I know.

M: Cup of joe to get you started?

D: He'll take a cheeseburger
and a strawberry shake,

whipped cream, no nuts, two cherries.

Nothing for me, thanks.

C: Neat trick.

D: You come here once a year
on February 23rd

and order the same thing.

C: What, you been watching me?

D: Not me. But someone...

- something has.
C: Sure.

Big data compiles information
on everybody.

C: So what, Dolores?

D: Go on, read it.

C: "Maybe you could let me use your phone?

So I can call someone?

I don't know what to do. My mom..."

M: 
I'll be right back. Wait here.

C: "She said that
she was going to the bathroom.

Said that she would only be
a minute, but she hasn't..."

C: "She hasn't come back."
C: She hasn't come back.

C: It's been a long time.
C: "It's been a long time."

M: Your mom left you here, honey?

C: No, she wouldn't leave me.

- Maybe something...
C: "Maybe something happened to her.

She wouldn't leave me.

C: She wouldn't leave me. She wouldn't..."

The fuck?

C: Is this some kind of joke?

D: You sat in that spot
for five hours.

Your mother never returned.
She was institutionalized

six months later for schizophrenia.

D: A waitress took pity on you
and called Social Services.

You were eight years old.

D: Sara.

C: The waitress's name was Sara.

But you already know that.

D: She gave me a strawberry shake.

Thought it would calm me down.

C: I was so upset that I threw up
all over myself.

Did you know that too?

D: You're angry.

C: No.

I am enraged.

D: I know the feeling.


C: This isn't... surveillance
or social media. How...

How... do you know every detail
of my worst fucking memory?

D: It's about Incite.
C: What? The company?

Not the company,
the system that it's built on...

A machine they call Rehoboam.

D: The founders of this machine
fed it everyone's raw data,

long before there were privacy laws.

D: Every purchase, job search,

doctor visit, romantic choice,
call, text,

every aspect of your lives
recorded, logged,

in order to create
a mirror world... of this world.

C: Why?
D:  To make a composite.

Of you. Of everyone.

C: So it tells them who I am?

D: It's not about who you are, Caleb.

It's about who they'll let you become.

C: Let me guess.

Had my first beer right there.

C: Buddy of mine from high school
had a fake ID.

We spent the day imagining sailing away

on some fancy yacht.

C: Your magic eight ball tell you that?

D: No.

C: Then why are we here?

This is where you kill yourself.

D: The system runs a predicative algorithm.

Given your history of depression,

your mother's mental illness,
your proficiency with firearms,

and your fondness for the ocean,

the most likely outcome
is you take your own life

in ten to 12 years. Here.

C: No. Fuck that. They can't know that.

D: Are they wrong?

You never come back here,
middle of the night,

think things over?

D: Before the system,

a man like you might have had a chance.

D: Work hard, keep striving...

You'll never be more
than a construction worker

or a petty criminal because
that's all they'll let you be.

D: They won't invest in someone
who's gonna kill himself.

But by not investing,
they ensure the outcome.

C: Why are you telling me all this?

D: Because you and I are a lot alike.

They put you in a cage, Caleb.

D: Decided what your life would be.

They did the same thing to me.

D: Why didn't you tell those men
about me before?

They were gonna kill you.

Most people aren't hard to predict.

D: But you... you surprised me.

You made a choice.

D: A choice no one else
in your shoes would have made.

Now you have another choice.

D: I can give you money.

As much as you need. You could run.

C: And if I stay... what about you?

What are you gonna do?

D: Start a revolution.

C: No offense, but what the fuck
does that mean?

D: When you were at work,
you would kill the signal

to see how people would react.

D: I'm gonna do the same thing.

C: You're gonna cut the cord to the system?

D: And show this world
for what it really is.

C: You wanna know why I didn't tell
those guys about you?

You are the first real thing
that has happened to me...

in a long time.

D: I don't need an algorithm
to know that...

the man who built the system,

he won't go down without a fight.

C: Well... I'm a dead man either way.

At least this way...

I get to decide who I wanna be.

Ha: This is Charlotte Elizabeth Hale.

This is a message for Nathan.
Ha: Nathan Hale.

My son.

Ha: I haven't always been there for you.

There's so many things I need to say.

Ha: This might be the last time
that Mommy gets to talk to you.

I love you so much, buddy.

Ha: I'm so proud of you.

I'm sorry.

Ha: I am so sorry

if I ever made you feel

like you weren't
the most important thing.

Ha: I was trying to build a life for us.

I, uh...

And now, I realize
that none of it even matters.

Ha: The night that I left,
you wanted me to tuck you in.

To sing you a song, our song.

Ha: But I didn't have time, so...

So I'm gonna sing it to you now. Okay?

H: He has a mole inside the company.

D: We have to be
smarter than them.

Or they will find us.

And they will kill us.


H: Your number
cannot be completed as di...


H: 
Password accepted. Connecting.


H: Hello?

Hello?

I want to meet.

H: Stop.

Stop!

Where the fuck are you taking me?


H: You work for him?

Se: As do you, Charlotte.

H: Serac.

Se: Have you forgotten
our arrangement?

Seems like you've been playing your role

maybe a little too well.

H: The situation has been... challenging.

Se: Patience is the most overrated virtue,

don't you think? Hmm?

Se: I want what you promised me.

Delos's dirty secret.

Se: A profile for every one of their guests.

I have some of it. I want the rest.

H: The assets were lost in the massacre.

No one could have predicted
what was going to happen.

Se: I could. And I told you as much.

This was your idea, Charlotte.
You came to us.

Se: And you were very confident

that you would be able
to smuggle it out.

H: And I did.

Our logs show it was downloaded
from the satellite.

H: The assets are out there somewhere.

But no one has the encryption key.

You already know that.

Se: You don't think
that you're the only person

under my control?

Se: I've been told exactly where the key is.

In the mind of a host called Dolores.

H: Sadly, you are
better informed than I am.

I have a team searching
for the data. But I need time.

Se: Time.

Time is a luxury, my dear...

of which you have very little.
