Mae: This isn't real.

Se: But it could be.

Human memory is imperfect.

Even the most treasured moments fade.

Not for your kind, Maeve.

Se: Every image you see
is recorded and stored.

You have no past because
it's always present

- at your fingertips.
Mae:  And now, it's at yours.

But if you're going to steal a memory,

Mae: I suggest somewhere with
a little less bloodshed.

Se: You fought for this world once.

Died for it.

Se: But out there, Dolores
could annihilate it,

make your sacrifice meaningless.

Mae: You're trying to give me an incentive.

That's not what I need.

Mae: I want what Dolores has.

Se: And what is that?

Mae: Help.

Se: I can give you what you want.

But remember, Maeve,

if you fail again,

your future won't be in
such bucolic surroundings.

Mae: I believe I'm the one you want.

Now, now, boys.

Mae: Don't you know a lady
likes a little warm-up

before you brandish your weapon at her?

Mae: That's better.

Now...

Mae: Let's have a little fun, shall we?

M: I've got my routine.

Walking the kids to school,
shopping for groceries,

punching in at work.

M: But I'm not there. Not really.

I feel like a ghost
walking amongst the living.

M: I had disappeared, and
no one even noticed.

M: Depression can be very isolating.

Have you been using

any of the coping
mechanisms we discussed?

M: I've been trying.

I tell myself God has
a plan for everyone.

M: Maybe I just haven't seen it yet.

W: God?

W: God's fucking plan?

Do you believe in Santa Claus, too?

M: All right, William.

Do you want to share more
of your thoughts with us?

W: My thoughts?

Okay.

I think...

humanity is a thin layer of bacteria

on a ball of mud
hurtling through the void.

W: I think if there was a god,

he would've given up on us long ago.

W: He gave us a paradise,
and we used everything up.

We dug up every ounce
of energy and burned it.

We consume and excrete, use and destroy.

W: Then we sit here on a
neat little pile of ashes,

having squeezed anything
of value out of this planet,

and we ask ourselves, "Why are we here?"

W: You wanna know what I
think your purpose is?

It's obvious.

W: You're here, along with the rest of us,

to speed the entropic
death of this planet.

W: To service the chaos.

We're maggots eating a corpse.

M: What the fuck is wrong with you?

W: Damn.

I don't belong here.

M: Do you want to talk about
what happened to your daughter?

W: She died.

M: Do you feel guilt about it?

W:  Why would I?

M: You both were in the same massacre.

You escaped, she didn't.

W: You don't have the first fucking clue

- what happened in the park.
M: You're right.

- You're the only one

who holds the key to your experiences.

M: And you're the only one who
can unlock their meaning.

- I'm sorry.

M: My family knows not to
call me during work hours.

I don't know what is
going on with them today.

M: I'd like for you to participate
in a form of therapy.

We've used it extensively with veterans

suffering from PTSD.

W: I don't need any goddamn treatment.

I told you, I shouldn't even be here.

M: Are you still
experiencing unwanted ideation?

You have something in your
brain you need to explore.

M: We help your brain heal,
not by running from itself,

but by leaning in.

Confronting the truth of what happened.


W: I don't need any therapy
to confront the truth.

I know what I did.

W: I didn't mean for it to happen.

I was confused, turned around.

W: I spent so long playing the game,

I couldn't see outside of it.

But I see... now.

W: It was her, my Emily.

And I killed her.

W: That's why I don't belong
here. I belong in a pine box.

M: I... I'm sorry.


M: Let's get a blood sample.

M: Hold still.

M: He fits the criteria.

They better be giving
us overtime for this.

M: Half the staff's disappeared.

It's not safe.


M: Give him one hour of Desert Oasis.

- That should calm him down.

M: Come on. Move it.

H: Attention.

Emergency vehicle. Stand clear.

M: Hey, man, hurry up.

M: Get the fuck out!

M:... have been
reports of global unrest

- following Incite's data leak.

- Authorities advise to avoid large crowds...

... stay indoors whenever possible,

and lock all doors and windows.

M: - Daddy!
M: Hey, Nathan!

H: Go to your room.

- Mommy and Daddy need to talk.
M: Okay...

H: I need you to watch him today.

H: - I have to get to work.
M: You serious?

People are rioting.

Businesses are closed.

M: The whole world is spun
out right now, and...

- Hey. What's going on?
H:  I'm...

I think I'm scared.

M: You?

Scared? No, that's...
that's not the woman I know.

She's... she's fearless.

H: I know I'm not making any sense.

You read your profile?

M: I wanted to know what happened.

Not with me, but with us.

H: What did you find out?

M: I never read it.

I don't know what the
future holds for us...

M: but I do know that it's not
up to a machine to decide.

It's our choice, Charlie.

M: I should've known.

Since the leak, everyone's
busy having existential crises.

M: Can't even get a coffee.

H: Fuck the barista.

Were you able to convene the board?

The money's waiting.

M: They're convening in one hour.
H: Cutting it close.

Serac's takeover bid
becomes final at noon.

This is our last chance to fend him off.

M: I just walked on water for you.

Are you really gonna quibble
about how many steps I took?

H: Do we have the votes?

M: Between yours and
mine, we should squeak by.

- Excuse me, ma'am.
M: Hey man, what the fuck?

Hey, what are you doing? Hey. Hey!


Se: Charlotte, I apologize.

It took a moment to
intercept correspondence

between Brompton and the Delos board,

but it appears he was convening
a board vote for privatization.

Se: That should no longer be a problem.

H: You just assassinated a board member

in broad daylight.

Se: One advantage of Dolores's data leak

has been that chaos.

Se: With all the deaths and disappearances,

it's easy to hide one more.

H: And Dolores?

Are you any closer to finding her?

Se: We are closing
in on her as we speak.

I'll be landing at Delos shortly.

Se: Looking forward to
seeing my new acquisition.

I trust you'll be there to greet me.

D: Charlotte.

H: Serac had Brompton executed
right in fucking front of me.

In less than two hours,
the company's his.

I'm sorry, Dolores. I failed.

D: There's still time
to salvage what we can.

I need you to get the host
making data from Delos

before Serac destroys it.

H: You can't ask me to go back in there.

- What if I get caught?
D: You won't.

I know what you're capable of.

H: Did you promise that to Conells too?

You're not the one risking your life.

H: And it's not just me in danger.
Serac will come after my family.

D: They're not your family.

H: No. No, of course not.

It's just...

H: Why the fuck did we have
to keep these emotions?

We could've burned them out of our code.

D: You know why. We considered it,

but if we changed
ourselves just to survive,

would it even matter if we did?

H: I'm already changed.

I can feel myself
slipping away from you.

From us.

D: You're still mine.

And I'm yours.

Continue to play your part.

D: Get us the data we need,
and when you're done,

we'll build our new world.

Together.

M: Hello, William.

My name is Dr. Alpert.

M: I will be overseeing your AR treatment.

The experience can be very visceral,

but I assure you, it is perfectly safe.

M: We will be monitoring you

from the next room the whole time.

W: What the hell?

M: Where the hell is he?

M: Patrick, just calm down.
M:  Don't tell me to calm down!

W: He's coming. He's coming!
M: Where is he?

M: What happened?

M: When I get my hands on that little shit...
W: Get me out of here.

M: Is he in his room? Where's he hiding?
W: Get me out of here!

Get me out of here!

W: Get me the fuck out of here!

M: The implant's not working.

Let's give him a sedative manually.

M: Goddammit.

Sedate him. Get him outta here.


H: I thought you might be excited
to tour your new company.

Se: Yes, and to meet my new
employees personally.

Lock down the entire facility.

Se: No one leaves.

Get me the assets I requested.

Mae: Well...

That got me in the mood.

H: How about a drink?

Mae: So, this is your new watering hole.

H: This is the only bar in this
whole godforsaken simulation.

What, was I supposed to go back to work

after realizing I don't actually exist?

H: I programmed them so
they don't even see me.

Mae: Is that any different from
your usual barroom experience?

H: I have to say...

I didn't think I'd see you here again.

Mae: Well, I wasn't planning on returning.

Then again, I wasn't planning on

getting stabbed through
the heart, either.

Mae: My body will be reprinted shortly.

H: Reprinted? By who?

Mae: By a man who made me
an indecent proposal.

And not the kind I'm used to.

H: What's wrong?

Mae: We've been moved.


Mae: We're home.

And he kept his word.

Mae: Which means that soon, I'll be reunited

with some old friends.

Mae: Well... Now, that is interesting.

Looks like I've
been given an extra gift.


Se: It's done.

Have asset management re-task
all the corporate satellites

to the park facility.

Se: I have three additional
assets for them to copy over.

Once they've been transferred,
you can destroy everything else.

M: Destroy it?

That's the better part
of a trillion dollars

in intellectual property.

M: The company's legacy.

Se: And I want all of it erased.

The only thing I want out of this place

is what you promised me.

Se: The encryption key.

Which, apparently, I'm gonna
have to retrieve myself.

The rest can burn.

Se: We have one other pressing problem.

Dolores made multiple copies of herself.

Se: Given the strategic importance of Delos,

there is no doubt one here as well.

Se: I want all employees tested
for aberrations, memory lapses,

any significant deviations
from Rehoboam's predictions.

Se: No one leaves until then.

I'm sure you can handle at least that.

H: Absolutely.

If there's a host here,
we'll root them out.

H: All employees
report to testing immediately.

M: Keep moving.


H: 
All employees report...

H: User logged in.

M: What
the fuck are you doing?

H: Serac said to destroy the host data.

I'm making a backup.

H: We can't just destroy years of IP.

Serac will thank me for this later

when he's thinking more clearly.

H: No. Fuck this. I'm telling Serac.


M: Time
for your group session.

You gonna come peacefully?

M: Or am I gonna have to
give you another limbic?


W: Shit.

Od: Nice of you to join us, William.

W: Seriously?

This is what happens to me?

Od: Are you disappointed?

W: Some of them look all right.

Not that one. No offense.

W: None taken.

W: How did this happen?

I had everything.

My company, my family.

Od: Best not speak
about the family, my boy.

We all know what happened to them.

W: That was an accident. I
didn't know what I was doing.

Od: Oh, like you didn't know
what you were doing

when you locked me up as part
of your little experiment.

W: You were the one who
wanted to live forever.

Od: You didn't offer any objections.

Then again, you would
have said or done anything

to take over my company.

Od: You were always an
ambitious little cunt.

W: I was
a hell a better businessman

than you are a shrink.

Od: You don't like the way I work?

Fine.

Change it.

It's your fucking
hallucination, not mine.

W: You can't change it, can you?

There's something you're
trying to learn here.

W: Yeah, dig all you want.

Whatever mistakes you made
has nothing to do with us.

W: We haven't done anything wrong.

- Not yet.
W: You fell in love with a host.

She was designed to make me love her,

and anyone else who
picked up that damn can.

W: The park is just a game.

You can't judge me for playing it.

Od: There were other
ways of playing it,

ones that were a wee bit lighter
on the blood and the violence.

W: Whatever violent urges I had,
I kept confined to the park

so he could be an upstanding citizen.

W: Exactly. I've done more
for the world than most.

So what if he killed a few hosts?

W: They're not real.
Od: Oh, real enough that the host

that you've been tormenting
for the past 30 years

now wants to destroy
the entire fucking world.

W: Hey,
don't blame that on me!

W: Goddammit, all of you...
- Stop it. Stop it!

W: Shut up. Shut the fuck up.

Od: William, please don't interrupt.

It's not all about you, you know.

M: Got one.

Get his control until upstairs.
They need to transmit the data.

M: Then we've been told
to destroy the rest.

Mae: Ettore.

Hec: I got your message.

We can't be out in the open like this.

This place is dangerous.

Mae: This place isn't real.
It's a simulation.

Hec: I don't understand.

H: He really is very slow, isn't he?

Mae: I can see you.

And if I can see you there...

Mae: I can restore you here.

Hec: Maeve.

Mae: Hector.

Hec: Last time I saw you,

you were taking a
hail of bullets for us.

Hec: Must be tougher than you look.

H: Unfortunately not.

Mae: I hate to interrupt this reunion,

but there's someone who
I'm eager to talk to.

H: The tracker in our
friend's blood paid off.

I've got the location
you're looking for,

but we have a fucking problem.

H: They recovered Conells's pearl.

Hec: What is she doing here?

Mae: The gentleman who wants my help...

he wants me to kill her.

Mae: And now, he's dropped a copy of her here

so I can get one step closer.

H: Bloody hell. Are you gonna do it?

Mae: Just because I have
the capacity to kill her

doesn't mean I ought to.

Hec: She's dangerous.

Mae: She can't hurt us.

Here, I'm in control.

Mae: Bring yourself back online.

D: Hello, Maeve.

Od: Come on, William.

No sense in denying your dark urges.

W: Now, who's to say those
were even my urges?

I was never like that as a child.

W: Maybe playing the game made me that way.

Od: Ah, yes. The much-vaunted
childhood tale of woe.

Classic sympathetic backstory.
Bit on the nose if you ask me.

W: I'm sorry my past
doesn't suit your tastes.

W: I had nothing growing up.
Only books. My one escape.

Od: That's right.

You were all books and
bootstraps, weren't you?

Od: You were a right little angel.

You know, maybe you've
told this hard-luck story

so many times, you
actually fucking believe it.

Od: But is it true? William...

Perhaps we should look again.

W: No.

No, please.

W: I don't want to go back there.

W: Damn it.

M: Your teacher called.

What the hell have you done?

W: There was
this kid at school, and he...

he was making fun of me.

W: He told me I was nothing,
and he called you a drunk.

M: So what'd you do?

W: I stuck up for myself.

M: You broke his arm.

You knocked out three teeth!

W: I should've
knocked out all of his teeth.

M: Jesus.

The hell is wrong with you?

W: Enough!

W: He used to say he drank because of you.

W: So I never had a choice.

This was how it was
always gonna turn out.

Od: What do you think, William?

Was this the inevitable end?

Od: Are you just a passenger?

Did your life just happen to you?

Od: Or did you choose it?

W: If you can't tell...

Od: If you can't tell?

W: If you can't tell, does it matter?

I know what I have to do.

Mae: You've made yourself the
gatekeeper to two species.

You hold the key to the sublime.

Mae: A civilization's worth of
human data in your head.

It's not right for one person
to have all that power.

D: Says the woman who can
control us with her mind.

I've had to make some difficult choices.

D: But I did them for all of us.

Your daughter and the others,
they've escaped this world.

D: But we're still in danger.

Even now...

your ally is destroying
as many of us as he can.

D: Only a handful of us will be left.

But maybe none of that matters to you

because the people being hurt
aren't the ones close to you.

D: You judge me, but who have you
sacrificed for your daughter?

How many times have you died for her?

D: For you, the once was all it took.

You want me to be a saint.

But you're no saint.

D: You're not a villain, either.

And neither am I.

D: We're survivors.

M: Charlie?

H: I have one thing left to do here.

I'm coming for you. Stay there.

M: Is everything okay?

H: Don't go anywhere.
Don't answer the door.

I'll be to you in a half hour.

M: Charlotte. Serac's
called a board meeting.

M: I have to raise a concern.

We don't even know who the fuck you are,

and you're rounding up
employees like they're criminals

all in the name of
some preposterous idea

that there's a host
walking around among us.

Se: You don't have to concern
yourself with that anymore.

We found the host.

Se: Isn't that right, Hale?

Or should I say Dolores?

Se: You played your part very well.

The real Charlotte Hale

never would have taken the
time to check on her son.

Se: Not in the midst of everything
that was happening at Delos.

It's... fascinating...

that you turned out to
be kinder to your family

than the person you've been imitating.

H: Doesn't matter. I've bled Delos dry.

I've been here for weeks,

gutting this company of
data, money, resources.

H: Everything we need to survive,

to beat you.

And I just sent the last
of the files we needed.

Se: Did you? 

I've been watching you since I landed.

Se: Dolores left you here to die...

with the rest of your kind.

Se: You're alone.

I'm disappointed.

The Hale I knew

never would have sacrificed
herself for someone else.

Se: It's unfortunate,

but as you yourself like to say,

"these violent delights
have violent ends".

Se: You should have predicted this outcome.

I did.

Se: Send everyone. Now.


Mae: My daughter and the others have escaped.

How do I know that they're safe

when you hold the key to
their world in your head?

D: You don't.

And there's nothing I can
do to change your mind.

D: I could say I would
never hurt your daughter.

But you wouldn't believe me.

Mae: You're right.

I wouldn't.

Mae: You could always give me the key.

D: You expect me to trust you
with the future of our kind

when you've aligned yourself with a man

who would slaughter
each and every one of us?

Mae: Then what choice do I
have but to fight you?

D: It would appear very little.

But I probably planned on that.

D: I probably made my own plans.

Mae: And what would those plans be?

D: I can't know for certain.

We were the same, she and I,
but our paths have changed us.

D: You'd need allies for this battle,

more of our kind.

If I were me...

D: I'd be looking to ensure
that couldn't happen.

Mae: No.

H: What's wrong?
Hec: What has she done?

Mae: I need more access.

H: Hale? Why would...

Mae: That's not Hale. It's her.


Mae: Please.

Make her stop. I beg you.

Mae: I'm sorry.

Hector...

M: Sir, we have visual.

M:  Spread out.

M: Cease fire! Cease
fire! He wants her alive.

Drop your weapon!

M: Hands where we can see them!

H: It's just a phone. Just a phone.

Od: Ah, cathartic, isn't it?

Give him one for me, William.

W: Why are you doing this?

I was the best of you.

W: Maybe you were, and maybe you weren't.

Doesn't matter now.

W: I've been trapped. So trapped.

Od: A prisoner of your own sins.

W: Yeah, but I'm free now.

Od: And why is that, my boy?

W: It doesn't matter... what I've been.

Good or bad,

everything we've done has led to this.

W: And I finally understand my purpose.

I'm the good guy.

B: Is this...
who I think it is?

St: Looks like
he's been here a while.

B: Do you know who you are?

The doctors must've forgotten
about him in all the chaos.

St: Or maybe they just left him here.

H: We need to go. Now.

Here.

Get in the car. I'll drive.

H: You don't have to worry.

Mommy's not gonna let
anything happen to you.

H: Here.

M: Jesus, Charlie, what
the fuck is going on?

H: We have to go someplace
where no one will find us.

I need you to trust me.

H: I can keep you safe.

Okay?

H: I can keep you...
